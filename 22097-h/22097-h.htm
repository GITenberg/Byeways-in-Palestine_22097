<h2><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>These papers on &ldquo;Byeways in Palestine&rdquo; are compiled from
notes of certain journeys made during many years&rsquo; residence in that
country; omitting the journeys made upon beaten roads, and through the
principal towns, for the mere reason that they were such.</p>
<p>Just what met the eye and ear was jotted down and is now revised after a
lapse of time, without indulging much in meditation or reflection; these
are rather suggested by the occurrences, that they may be followed out by
the reader.&nbsp; Inasmuch, however, as the incidents relate to
out-of-the-way places, and various seasons of the year, they may be found
to contain an interest peculiar to themselves, and the account of them may
not interfere with any other book on Palestine.</p>
<p>I may state that, not being a professed investigator, <!-- page vi--><a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>I carried with me no
scientific instruments, except sometimes a common thermometer: I had no
leisure for making excavations, for taking angles with a theodolite, or
attending to the delicate care of any kind of barometer, being employed on
my proper business.</p>
<p>Riding by night or by day, in the heat of Syrian summer, or through
snows and piercing winds of winter on the mountains, I enjoyed the pure
climate for its own sake.&nbsp; Moreover, I lived among the people, holding
intercourse with peasants in villages, with Bedaween in deserts, and with
Turkish governors in towns, or dignified Druses in the Lebanon, and slept
in native dwellings of all qualities, as well as in convents of different
sects: in the open air at the foot of a tree, or in a village
mosque&mdash;in a cavern by the highway side, or beneath cliffs near the
Dead Sea: although more commonly within my own tent, accompanied by native
servants with a small canteen.</p>
<p>Sad cogitations would arise while traversing, hour after hour, the
neglected soil, or passing by desolated villages which bear names of
immense antiquity, and which stand as memorials of miraculous events which
took place for our instruction <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>and for that of all succeeding ages; and then,
even while looking forward to a better time to come, the heart would sigh
as the expression was uttered, &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These notices will show that the land is one of remarkable fertility
wherever cultivated, even in a slight degree&mdash;witness the vast
wheat-plains of the south; and is one of extreme beauty&mdash;witness the
green hill-country of the north; although such qualities are by no means
confined to those districts.&nbsp; Thus it is not necessary, it is not
just, that believers in the Bible, in order to hold fast their confidence
in its predictions for the future, should rush into the extreme of
pronouncing the Holy Land to be cursed in its present capabilities.&nbsp;
It is verily and indeed cursed in its government and in its want of
population; but still the soil is that of &ldquo;a land which the Lord thy
God careth for.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a deep meaning in the words,
&ldquo;The earth is the Lord&rsquo;s,&rdquo; when applied to that peculiar
country; for it is a reserved property, an estate in abeyance, and not even
in a subordinate sense can it be the fief of the men whom it eats up.&nbsp;
(Numb. xiii. 32, and Ezek. xxxvi. 13, 14.)&nbsp; I have seen enough to
convince me that astonishing will be the amount <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>of its produce, and
the rapidity also, when the obstacles now existing are removed.</p>
<p>With respect to antiquarian researches, let me express my deep interest
in the works now undertaken under the Palestine Exploration Fund.&nbsp; My
happiness, while residing in the country, would have been much augmented
had such operations been at that time, <i>i.e.</i>, between 1846 and 1863,
commenced in Jerusalem or elsewhere in the Holy Land.</p>

ix</span>NOTE.</h2>
<p>The frontispiece picture to this volume represents the relic of a small
Roman Temple, situated on the eastern edge of the Plain of Sharon, near the
line of hills, between the two villages Awali and
M&rsquo;zeera&rsquo;a.</p>
<p>It is quadrangular in form, with a door and portico on its north
front.</p>
<p>The portico is supported by two round columns of Corinthian order, and
two pilasters of the same at the extremities.&nbsp; The columns are of
small dimensions, the shafts not exceeding nine feet in length; yet in
these the canon is observed which obtains in the larger proportions found
in classic lands, namely, that the diameter is somewhat extended near the
half elevation from the ground.&nbsp; The capitals are of the best
design.</p>
<p>The doorway is formed by a very bold and deep moulding, and in the
upright side-posts is found the same arrangement for holding a stone bar in
confining <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>the door, as is to be seen in some sepulchres about Jerusalem,
namely, a curved groove increasing in depth of incision as it descends.</p>
<p>The whole edifice bears the same warm tinge of yellow that all those of
good quality acquire from age in that pure climate.</p>
<p>The roof has been repaired, and the walls in some parts patched up.</p>
<p>On the southern wall, internally, the Moslems have set up a Kebleh niche
for indicating the direction of prayer.</p>
<p>The peasants call this building the &ldquo;Boorj,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near adjoining it are remains of ancient foundations: one quite circular
and of small diameter.</p>
<p>There is also by the road-side, not far off, a rocky grotto, supplied
with water by channels from the hills.</p>
<p>My sketches of this interesting relic date from 1848 and 1859, and, as
far as I am aware, no other traveller had seen it until lately, when the
members of the Palestine Exploration Expedition visited and took a
photograph of it, which is now published.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>I.&nbsp; OVER THE JORDAN AND RETURN BY THE WEST.</h2>
<p>We were a dozen Englishmen, including three clergymen, undertaking the
above journey accompanied by the large train of servants, interpreters, and
muleteers usually required for travelling in the East.&nbsp; And it was on
Wednesday, the 9th day of May 1855, that we started.&nbsp; This was
considered almost late in the season for such an enterprise.&nbsp; The
weather was hot, chiefly produced by a strong shirocco wind at the time;
and, in crossing over the shoulder of the Mount of Olives, we found the
country people beginning their harvest at Bethany.</p>
<p>We were of course escorted by a party of Arab guides, partly villagers
of either <i>Abu Dis</i> or <i>Selwan</i>, (Siloam,) and partly of those
Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs not deserving the appellation of Bedaween, who live
around and about Jericho.&nbsp; These people, of <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>both classes, form a
partnership for convoy of travellers to the Jordan under arrangements made
at the consulate.&nbsp; Without them it would be impossible either to find
the way to Jericho and the river, or to pass along the deserted road, for
there are always out-lookers about the tops of the hills to give notice
that you are without an escort, and you would consequently still find that
travellers may &ldquo;fall among thieves&rdquo; between Jerusalem and
Jericho; besides that, on descending to the plain of Jericho you would
certainly become the prey of other Arabs of real tribes, ever passing about
there&mdash;including most probably the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n, to whose
hospitality, however, we were now about to commit ourselves.&nbsp; To all
this must be added, that no other Arabs dare undertake to convoy travellers
upon that road; the Ta&aacute;mra to the south have long felt their
exclusion from it to be a great grievance, as the gains derived from the
employment of escorting Europeans are very alluring.</p>
<p>We had with us a deputed commissioner from the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n,
namely, Shaikh Fendi, a brother of Shaikh &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l
&rsquo;Azeez.&nbsp; He was delighted with the refreshment of eating a
cucumber, when we rested by the wayside to eat oranges&mdash;the delicious
produce of Jaffa.</p>
<p>Passing the <i>Fountain of the Apostles</i>, (so called,) we jogged
along a plain road till we reached a booth for selling cups of coffee, at
the divergence of the road Nebi Moosa, (the reputed sepulchre <!-- page
3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>of the prophet
Moses, according to the Mohammedans,) then up an ascent still named
<i>Tela&rsquo;at ed Dum</i>, which is certainly the ancient <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> Adummim,
(Joshua xv. 7)&mdash;probably so called from broad bands of <i>red</i>
among the strata of the rocks.&nbsp; Here there are also curious wavy lines
of brown flint, undulating on a large scale among the limestone
cliffs.&nbsp; This phenomenon is principally to be seen near the ruined and
deserted Khan, or eastern lodging-place, situated at about half the
distance of our journey.&nbsp; The name is <i>Khatroon</i>.</p>
<p>As we proceeded, our escort, mostly on foot, went on singing merrily,
and occasionally bringing us tufts of scented wild plants found in crevices
by the roadside.&nbsp; Then we came to long remains of an ancient water
conduit, leading to ruins of a small convent.&nbsp; In a few minutes after
the latter, we found ourselves looking down a fearfully deep precipice of
rocks on our left hand, with a stream flowing at the bottom, apparently
very narrow indeed, and the sound of it scarcely audible.&nbsp; This is the
brook <i>Kelt</i>, by some supposed to be the <i>Cherith</i> of
Elijah&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Suddenly we were on the brow of a deep
descent, with the Gh&ocirc;r, or Jericho plain, and the Dead Sea spread out
below.&nbsp; In going down, we had upon our left hand considerable
fragments of ancient masonry, containing lines of Roman reticulated
brickwork.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>It
was now evening; a breeze, but not a cool one, blowing; and we left aside
for this time the pretty camping station of Elisha&rsquo;s Fountain,
because we had business to transact at the village of Er-Rihha, (or
Jericho.)&nbsp; There accordingly our tents were pitched; and in a circle
at our doors were attentive listeners to a narration of the events of
Lieut. Molyneux&rsquo;s Expedition on the Jordan and Dead Sea in 1847.</p>
<p>Thermometer after sunset, inside the tent, at 89&deg; Fahrenheit.&nbsp;
Sleep very much disturbed by small black sandflies and ants.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer at 76&deg; before
sunrise.&nbsp; The scene around us was animated and diversified; but
several of us had been accustomed to Oriental affairs&mdash;some for a good
many years; and some were even familiar with the particular localities and
customs of this district.&nbsp; Others were young in age, and fresh to the
country; expressing their wonderment at finding themselves so near to
scenes read of from infancy&mdash;scarcely believing that they had at
length approached near to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;That bituminous lake<br />
Where Sodom stood,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and filled with joyous expectation at the visit so soon to be made to
the Jordan, and beyond it.&nbsp; Some were quoting Scripture; some quoting
poetry; and others taking particular notice of the wild Arabs, who were by
this time increasing in number <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>about us,&mdash;their spears, their mares, their
guttural language, and not less the barren desert scene before us, being
objects of romantic interest.</p>
<p>At length all the tents and luggage were loaded on the mules, and ten
men of the village were hired for helping to convey our property across the
river; and we went forward over the strange plain which is neither desert
sand, as in Africa, nor wilderness of creeping plants and flowers, as on
the way to Petra, but a puzzling, though monotonous succession of low
eminences,&mdash;of a nature something like rotten chalk ground, if there
be such a thing in existence,&mdash;between which eminences we had to wind
our way, until we reached the border of tamarisk-trees, large reeds,
willow, aspen, etc., that fringes the river; invisible till one reaches
close upon it.</p>
<p>At the bathing (or baptism) place of the Greeks, northwards from that of
the Latins, to which English travellers are usually conducted, we had to
cross, by swimming as we could. <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; King David, on his return
from exile, had a ferry-boat to carry over his household, but we had
none.&nbsp; Probably, on his escaping from Absalom, he crossed as we
did.</p>
<p>The middle part of the river was still too deep for mere fording.&nbsp;
Horses and men had to swim; so the gentlemen sat still on their saddles,
with <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>their feet put up on the necks of their horses, which were led by
naked swimming Arabs in the water holding the bridles, one on each
side.</p>
<p>Baggage was carried over mostly on the animals; but had to be previously
adjusted and tightened, so as to be least liable to get wetted.&nbsp; Small
parcels were carried over on the heads of the swimmers.&nbsp; These all
carried their own clothes in that manner.&nbsp; One of the luggage mules
fell with his load in the middle of the stream.&nbsp; It was altogether a
lively scene.&nbsp; Our Arabs were much darker over the whole body than I
had expected to find them; and the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n have long plaits of
hair hanging on the shoulders when the <i>kefieh</i>, or coloured
head-dress, is removed.&nbsp; The horses and beasts of burden were often
restive in mid-current, and provoked a good deal of merriment.&nbsp; Some
of the neighbouring camps having herds of cattle, sent them to drink and to
cool themselves in the river, as the heat of the day increased.&nbsp; Their
drivers urged them in, and then enjoyed the fun of keeping them there by
swimming round and round them.&nbsp; One cow was very nearly lost, however,
being carried away rapidly and helplessly in the direction of the Dead Sea,
but she was recovered.&nbsp; The Jericho people returned home, several of
them charged with parting letters addressed to friends in Jerusalem; and we
were left reposing, literally reposing, on the eastern bank,&mdash;the
English chatting happily; the Arabs smoking or sleeping under shade of
trees; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>pigeons cooing among the thick covert, and a Jordan nightingale
soothing us occasionally, with sometimes a hawk or an eagle darting along
the sky; while the world-renowned river rolled before our eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis &aelig;vum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The novelty of the scenes, and the brilliancy of the atmosphere, as well
the vivacity of the recent transactions in &ldquo;passing over
Jordan,&rdquo; had their duly buoyant effect upon youthful
persons,&mdash;who were, however, not forgetful of past events in these
places belonging to sacred history.</p>
<p>The baggage went on; but, as the appointed halting-place was only about
two hours distant, we remained enjoying ourselves as we were during most of
the day.</p>
<p>Among our novel friends is an Arab hero named <i>Gubl&acirc;n</i>, as
they pronounce it here, (but it is really the Turkish word
<i>Kapl&acirc;n</i>, meaning <i>Tiger</i>,) and his uncle, old
&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez.&nbsp; About three years before,
Gubl&acirc;n had been attacked by Government soldiers at Jericho.&nbsp; He
made a feigned retreat, and, leading them into the thickets of Neb&rsquo;k
trees, suddenly wheeled round and killed six of them.&nbsp; The humbled
Government force retired, and the dead were buried, by having a mound of
earth piled over them.&nbsp; Of course, such an incident was never reported
to the Sublime Invincible Porte at Constantinople; but it was a curious
coincidence, that this very morning, <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>amid our circle before
the tents, after breakfast and close to that mound, we had Gubl&acirc;n,
&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez, and the Turkish Aga of the present time,
all peaceably smoking pipes together in our company.</p>
<p>Among our gentlemen we had a man of fortune and literary attainments,
who had been in Algiers, and now amused himself with dispensing with
servants or interpreters&mdash;speaking some Arabic.&nbsp; He brought but
very light luggage.&nbsp; This he placed upon a donkey, and drove it
himself&mdash;wearing Algerine town costume.&nbsp; The Bedaween, however,
as I need scarcely say, did not mistake him for an Oriental.</p>
<p>Moving forward in the afternoon, we were passing over the <i>Plains of
Moab</i>, &ldquo;on this [east] side Jordan by Jericho&rdquo;&mdash;where
Balaam, son of Beor, saw, from the heights above, all Israel encamped, and
cried out, &ldquo;How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! and thy tabernacles, O
Israel!&nbsp; As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
river&rsquo;s side, as the trees of lign-aloes which the Lord hath planted,
and as cedar-trees beside the waters. . . .&nbsp; Blessed is he that
blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee,&rdquo; (Num. xxii. I,
and xxiv. 5, 6, 9.)&nbsp; This territory is also called the <i>Land of
Moab</i>, where the second covenant was made with the people by the
ministry of Moses&mdash;the one &ldquo;beside the covenant which he made
with them in Horeb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our ride was a gradual ascent; and after some <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>time we were met by young
&rsquo;Ali, the favourite son of the principal Shaikh D&euml;&acirc;b,
(Wolf,) with a small but chosen escort, sent on by his father to welcome
us.&nbsp; We saw a good deal of corn land, and people reaping their
harvest.&nbsp; This belongs to two or three scattered villages about there,
under the immediate protection of the D&euml;&acirc;b
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n.&nbsp; The Arabs, however, in this part of the world, do
condescend to countenance and even to profit by agriculture, for they buy
slaves to sow and reap for them.</p>
<p>In two hours and a half from the Jordan we came to our halting-place, at
a spot called <i>Cuferain</i>, (&ldquo;two villages&rdquo;)&mdash;the
Kiriathaim of Jer. xlviii. 23&mdash;at the foot of the mountain, with a
strong stream of water rushing past us.&nbsp; No sign, however, of
habitations: only, at a little distance to the south, were ruins of a
village called <i>Er Ram</i>, (a very common name in Palestine; but this is
not Ramoth-Gilead;) and at half an hour to the north was an inhabited
village called <i>Nimrin</i>, from which the stream flowed to us.&mdash;See
Jer. xlviii. 34: &ldquo;The waters of Nimrin shall be desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had a refreshing breeze from the north which is justly counted a
luxury in summer time.&nbsp; The shaikhs came and had coffee with me.&nbsp;
They said that on the high summits we shall have cooler temperature than in
Jerusalem, which is very probable.</p>
<p>After dinner I sat at my tent-door, by the rivulet side, looking
southwards over the Dead Sea, and <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to the west over the line of the promised land
of Canaan, which I had never before had an opportunity of seeing in that
manner, although the well-known verse had been often repeated in
England&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh could I stand where Moses stood,<br />
&nbsp;  And view the landscape o&rsquo;er,<br />
Not Death&rsquo;s cold stream nor Jordan&rsquo;s flood<br />
&nbsp;  Should fright me from the shore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then read over to myself in Arabic, the Psalms for the evening
service&mdash;namely, liii., liv., and lv.</p>
<p>About sunset there was an alarm that a lad who had accompanied us as a
servant from Jerusalem was missing ever since we left the Jordan.&nbsp;
Horse-men were sent in every direction in search of him.&nbsp; It was
afterwards discovered that he had returned to Jericho.</p>
<p>At about a hundred yards south of us was a valley called
<i>Se&rsquo;eer</i>, (its brook, however, comes down from the
north)&mdash;abounding in fine rosy oleander shrubs.</p>
<p>During the night the water near us seemed alive with croaking
frogs.&nbsp; Last night we had the sand-flies to keep us awake.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 66&deg; before
sunrise.&nbsp; My earliest looks were towards Canaan, &ldquo;that goodly
land&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the hills, from which cometh my help.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How keen must have been the feeling of his state of exile when David was
driven to this side the river!</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Before breakfast I bathed in the Se&rsquo;eer, among bushes of
oleander and the strong-scented <i>ghar</i>&mdash;a purple-spiked flower
always found adjoining to or in water-beds.&nbsp; Then read my Arabic
Psalms as usual.</p>
<p>Before starting, young &rsquo;Ali and his party asked us all for
presents, and got none.&nbsp; We gave answer unanimously that we meant to
give presents to his father when we should see him.&nbsp; Strange how
depraved the Arab mind becomes on this matter of asking for gifts wherever
European travellers are found!&mdash;so different from the customs of
ancient times, and it is not found in districts off the common tracks of
resort.</p>
<p>Our road lay up the hills, constantly growing more steep and
precipitous, and occasionally winding between large rocks, which were often
overgrown with honeysuckle in full luxuriance.&nbsp; The Arabs scrambled
like wild animals over the rocks, and brought down very long streamers of
honeysuckle, Luw&acirc;yeh, as they call it, which they wound round and
round the necks of our horses, and generally got piastres for doing
so.&nbsp; About two-thirds of the distance up the ascent we rested, in
order to relieve the animals, or to sketch views, or enjoy the glorious
scenery that lay extended below us&mdash;comprising the Dead Sea, the line
of the river trees, Jericho, the woods of Elisha&rsquo;s Fountain, and the
hills towards Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Bedaween have eyes like eagles; and some
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>avouched that they could see the Mount of Olives, and the minaret
upon its summit.&nbsp; They indicated to us the positions of Es-Salt and of
Heshb&acirc;n.</p>
<p>We had now almost attained a botanical region resembling that of the
Jerusalem elevation, instead of the Indian vegetation upon the Jordan
plain; only there was <i>ret&rsquo;m</i> (the juniper of 1 Kings xix. 4) to
be found, with pods in seed at that season; but we had also our long
accustomed terebinth and arbutus, with honeysuckle and pink
ground-convolvulus.&nbsp; The rocks were variegated with streaks of pink,
purple, orange, and yellow, as at Khatroon, on the Jerusalem road.&nbsp;
Partridges were clucking among the bushes; and the bells on the necks of
our mules lulled us with their sweet chime, as the animals strolled
browsing around in the gay sunshine.</p>
<p>When we moved forward once more, it was along paths of short zigzags
between cliffs, so that our procession was constantly broken into small
pieces.&nbsp; At length we lost sight of the Gh&ocirc;r and the Dead Sea;
and after some time traversing miles of red and white cistus, red
everlasting, and fragrant thyme and sage, with occasional terebinth-trees
festooned with honeysuckle, we came upon a district covered with millions,
or billions, or probably trillions, of locusts, not fully grown, and only
taking short flights; but they greatly annoyed our horses.&nbsp; My choice
Arab, being at that time ridden by my <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>servant, fairly bolted
away with fright for a considerable distance.</p>
<p>At length we halted at a small spring oozing from the soil of the
field.&nbsp; The place was called <i>Hheker Zaboot</i>&mdash;a pretty
place, and cuckoos on the trees around us; only the locusts were
troublesome.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez proposed that instead of going at once
to Ammon, we should make a detour by Heshbon and Elealeh, on the way to his
encampment.&nbsp; To this we all assented.</p>
<p>During the ride forward the old shaikh kept close to me, narrating
incidents of his life,&mdash;such as his last year&rsquo;s losses by the
Beni Sukh&rsquo;r, who plundered him of all his flocks and herds, horses,
tents, and even most of his clothing,&mdash;then described the march of
Ibrahim Pasha&rsquo;s army in their disastrous attempt upon Kerak: also
some of the valiant achievements of his kinsman Gubl&acirc;n; and then
proceeding to witticism, gave me his etymological origin of the name of
Hhesb&acirc;n&mdash;namely, that, on the subsiding of the great deluge, the
first object that Noah perceived was that castle, perched as it is upon a
lofty peak; whereupon he exclaimed, <i>Hhus&rsquo;n
b&acirc;n</i>&mdash;&ldquo;a castle appears!&rdquo;&nbsp; I wish I could
recollect more of his tales.</p>
<p>After passing through romantic scenery of rocks and evergreen trees, at
a sudden turn of the road we came to large flocks and herds drinking, or
couched beside a copious stream of water gushing <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>from near the foot of a
rocky hill.&nbsp; This they called <i>&rsquo;Ain Hhesb&acirc;n</i>; and
told us that the Egyptian army above alluded to, twenty thousand in number,
passed the night there before arriving at Kerak.&nbsp; To many of them it
was their last night on earth.</p>
<p>There were remains of large masonry lying about, and the scene was truly
beautiful&mdash;to which the bells of the goats and cows added a charming
musical effect.</p>
<p>I asked an Arab, who was bathing in a pool, where he had come from, and
he sulkily answered, &ldquo;From t&rsquo;other end of the
world!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I suppose he was right in saying so, for what
meaning could he attach to the designation, <i>the world</i>.&nbsp; He must
have meant the world of his own experience, or that of his tribe, or his
parents&mdash;probably extending to the end of the Dead Sea in one
direction, to the Lake of Tiberias in another; to the Mediterranean in the
west, and in the east to the wilds unknown beyond the road of the
Hh&acirc;j pilgrimage.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the other end of the world,&rdquo;
quoth he, the companion of a shepherd boy with his flute, at a mountain
spring, pitching pebbles at the sheep of his flock to keep them from
wandering away over their extent of &ldquo;the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we proceeded, there were several other streams issuing from the
hills, some of them falling in pretty cascades into thickets of oleander
below.&nbsp; All these meeting together, formed a line <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of river flowing
between grassy banks&mdash;near which we saw considerable remains of
water-mills, not of great antiquity.</p>
<p>Next we reached two small forts: the one upon our side the stream they
called <i>Shuneh</i>, (the usual name used for that kind of building;) the
other was across the water, and they called it <i>Shefa
&rsquo;Amer</i>.&nbsp; I should wonder if our guides knew the existence of
the town called <i>Shefa &rsquo;Amer</i>, near Caiffa.&nbsp; They told us
that both these forts had been erected by D&euml;&acirc;b&rsquo;s
grandfather, but this is incredible.</p>
<p>Near the Shuneh I observed a very large sarcophagus, cut in the solid
rock, but not so far finished as to allow of its being removed.&nbsp; In
the court-yard there was nothing remarkable.&nbsp; There were, however,
some ancient rabbeted stones lying near.&nbsp; Here I may remark, with
respect to the sarcophagus, that such things are rare on the east of the
Jordan, or anywhere else so far to the south.&nbsp; There are two lids of
such lying on the plain of Sharon, alongside the Jaffa road from Jerusalem;
and the next southernmost one that I know of (excepting those at Jerusalem)
is an ornamented lid, near Sebustieh, the ancient Samaria; but they abound
in Ph&oelig;nicia.</p>
<p>Forward again we went, higher and higher, with wild flowers in
profusion, and birds carolling all around.&nbsp; Then literally climbing up
a mountain side, we came to a cleft in a precipice, which they called <i>El
Buaib</i>, (the little gate,) with <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>unmistakable marks of
ancient cuttings about there.&nbsp; Traversing a fine plain of wheat, we at
length reached the ancient city of Heshbon, with its acropolis of temple
and castle.</p>
<p>That plain would be fine exercise-ground for the cavalry of Sihon, king
of the Amorites.&nbsp; Fresh, and almost chilly, was the mountain air; but
the sky rather cloudy.</p>
<p>How magnificent was the prospect over to Canaan!&nbsp; We were all
persuaded that the Mount of Olives would be visible thence on a fine day;
and I have no doubt whatever that the site on which we were standing is
that peak&mdash;the only peak breaking the regular outline of the Moab
mountains which is seen from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We scattered ourselves about in several groups among pavements and
columns of temples, (the most perfect of which are in the Acropolis,)
sepulchres, cisterns, and quarries, picking up fragments of pottery, with
some pattern work (not highly ornamental, however) upon them, and
tesser&aelig; or the cubes of tesselated pavement, such as may be found all
over Palestine.&nbsp; The Bedaween call them <i>muzzateem</i> or
<i>muzzameet</i> indifferently.&nbsp; There were some good Corinthian
capitals, fragments of cornices, and portions of semicircular arches, and
pieces of walls that had been repaired at different periods.&nbsp; I
entered one rock-hewn sepulchre which contained seven small chambers; six
of these had been evidently broken into by <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>main force, the seventh
was still closed.&nbsp; This was S.W. of the Acropolis.</p>
<p>All the works or ornamentations above ground were of Greek or Roman
construction, but we found no inscriptions or coins.&nbsp; Heshbon must
have been at all periods a strong place for defence, but with an unduly
large proportion of ornamentation to the small size of the city according
to modern ideas.&nbsp; Before leaving this site, far inferior to
&rsquo;Amm&acirc;n, as we found afterwards, I got the Arabs around me upon
a rising ground, and, with a compass in hand, wrote down from their
dictation the names of sites visible to their sharp eyesight:&mdash;</p>

<p>These must have been the places that &ldquo;stood under the shadow of
Heshbon,&rdquo; (Jer. xlviii. 45.)&nbsp; One of them at least appears in
Joshua xiii. 17, etc., among &ldquo;the cities that are in the plain of
Heshbon.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>In
half an hour we came to <i>Ela&rsquo;&acirc;l</i>, (Elealeh,) (Isa. xv. 4
and xvi. 9, and Jer. xlviii. 34.)&nbsp; Large stones were lying about, and
one column standing upright, but without a capital.&nbsp; Fine corn-plains
in every direction around.&nbsp; Our tents pitched at <i>Na&rsquo;oor</i>
were visible to the E.N.E. through an opening between two hills.&nbsp; Cool
cloudy day; all of us enjoying the ride through wheat-fields, and over
large unoccupied plains&mdash;my old friend &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l
&rsquo;Azeez still adhering to me as his willing auditor.</p>
<p>On coming up to his camp at Na&rsquo;oor, we found that Shaikh
D&euml;&acirc;b had already arrived.</p>
<p>And now I may pause in the narrative to describe the <i>status</i> of
(1.) ourselves; (2.) the Arabs.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Although apparently forming one company of English
travellers, we were really a combination of several small sets, of two or
three persons each&mdash;every set having its own cook, muleteer, and
dragoman; but all the sets on terms of pleasant intercourse, and smoking or
taking tea with each other.</p>
<p>We calculated that our horses and mules amounted to above a hundred in
number.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The whole territory from Kerak to Jerash is that of our
&rsquo;Adwan tribe, but divided into three sections&mdash;the middle
portion being that of the supreme chief D&euml;&acirc;b, the northern third
that of &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez, and the southern that of a third
named Altchai in the south towards Kerak; but <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>they all combine when
necessary for a general object.</p>
<p>The &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n sow corn by the labour of their purchased
slaves.&nbsp; Gubl&acirc;n at Cuferain, D&euml;&acirc;b and his son
&rsquo;Ali at Nimrin, and a portion of the tribe called &ldquo;the children
of Eyoob&rdquo; cultivate in the same manner a tract near the Dead Sea
called the <i>Mezraa&rsquo;</i>.&nbsp; These latter attach themselves
sometimes to the D&euml;&acirc;b section, called the <i>Dar &rsquo;Ali</i>,
and sometimes to the Gubl&acirc;n section, called the <i>Dar
Nim&rsquo;r</i>.</p>
<p>Their district is but a comparatively narrow strip at present, as they
are pressed upon by the <i>Beni Sukh&rsquo;r</i> on the east, who are again
pressed upon by the <i>&rsquo;Anezeh</i> farther eastward; these last are
allies of our people.</p>
<p>The Gh&ocirc;r or Jordan plain is open ground for all Arabs; and a few
low fellows called Abb&acirc;d Kattaleen, hold a slip of ground downwards
between Es-Salt and the Jordan.&nbsp; Es-Salt is a populous and thriving
town, the only one in all that country.&nbsp; Kerak, to the south, may be
as large, and contain more remnants of medi&aelig;val strength, but its
affairs are not so prosperous.</p>
<p>This station of Na&rsquo;oor <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> is upon a long, low, green
plain, lying between two lines of high ground; and on a map, it would be
nearly central between the <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>northern and southern extremities of the
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n country, or Belka. <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>Strange and wild was the scene of the Bedawi encampment&mdash;the black
tents of goats&rsquo; hair, the dark and ragged population sauntering
about, the flocks and the horses, the ragged or naked children; and then
the women in their blue, only article of dress, long-sleeved, their
uncombed hair, and lips dyed blue, all walking with dignity of step, most
of them employed in hanging up washed fleeces of wool to dry.&nbsp; One in
particular I remarked for her stately appearance, with the blue dress
trailing long behind, and the sleeves covering her hands; she was giving
commands to others.</p>
<p>As soon as we were well settled, and the first confusion over in making
our several arrangements with servants, etc., Shaikh D&euml;&acirc;b sent a
messenger asking permission for him to pay us a visit of welcome; and a
serious ceremonial visit took place accordingly.&nbsp; The great man was
arrayed in green silk, and carried a silver-handled sword and dagger; a few
chosen men of the tribe formed his train; coffee, pipes, and long
compliments followed.&nbsp; We all remarked his keen eyes, ardent like
those of a hawk in pursuit of prey.&nbsp; On taking leave he announced his
intention of presenting each gentleman with a sheep for our evening
meal.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>As
soon as the indispensable solemnity of his visit was over, the camp became
more animated; the sheep were slaughtered; various parties being formed for
the feast, which was finished by the Arabs; and I invited all to my tent
for tea at night, when the weather became so piercing cold that I found it
necessary to have some hot brandy and water to drink.</p>
<p>In this place I wish to say how excellent is animal food dressed
immediately after killing.&nbsp; The practice is found, all through the
Bible histories, from Abraham entertaining the angels at Mamre, to the
father of the prodigal son killing the fatted calf for his reception.&nbsp;
At that stage the meat is exceedingly tender and delicate; whereas, if
left, as the European practice is, for some time after killing, it has to
go through another and less wholesome process in order to become tender
again.&nbsp; There are numerous medical opinions in favour of the Oriental
method of cooking the food immediately.</p>
<p>Another observation will not be out of place, on the almost universal
eating of mutton throughout Asia.&nbsp; I do not mean the anti-beef-eating
Brahmins of India, but in all countries of Asia, by eating of meat is
understood the eating of mutton, and horned cattle are reserved for
agricultural labour.&nbsp; In case of exceptions being met with, they are
only such few exceptions as help to prove the rule.&nbsp; This may perhaps
be attributed to the general insecurity <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of animal property in
the East; but that I do not think a sufficient reason to account for
it.&nbsp; It seems, however, that the ancient Israelites were not so much
limited to eating from the small cattle.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer 37&deg; just before
sunrise, nearly thirty degrees lower than under the same circumstances two
days before.&nbsp; The night had been cold and damp; the grass was found
wet in the places sheltered from the current of wind, which had elsewhere
formed hoarfrost over the field.&nbsp; This reminded us of the elevation we
had reached to; and we all exclaimed as to the reasonableness of
Jacob&rsquo;s expostulation with Laban, when he asserted that &ldquo;in the
day the drought [or heat] consumed him, and the frost by night,&rdquo;
(Gen. xxxi. 40.)&nbsp; We were upon frozen ground in the month of May,
after passing through a flight of locusts on the preceding day.</p>
<p>A lively scene was the packing up.&nbsp; &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l
&rsquo;Azeez was happy at seeing us all happy, and laying hold of a couple
of dirty, ragged urchins, he shook them well, and lifted them up from the
ground, and offered them to me, saying, &ldquo;Here, take these little imps
of mine, and do what you like with them; send them to England if you will,
for they are growing up like beasts here, and what can I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;
All I could do was to speak cheerfully to them, and make them some little
presents.&nbsp; At the door of D&euml;&acirc;b&rsquo;s tent was his bay
mare of high race, and his <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>spear planted beside her.&nbsp; He accompanied
us as far as his own encampment, two or three hours over wide plains and
grassy pastures.&nbsp; Soon after leaving Na&rsquo;oor he took us up a
small hill, which was called <i>Setcher</i>, (probably <i>Setker</i> in
town pronunciation,) where there were some ruins of no considerable amount,
but the stones of cyclopean size.&nbsp; Query&mdash;Were these remains of
the primeval Zamzummim?&nbsp; (Deut. ii. 20.)</p>
<p>At <i>Dahair el Hhum&acirc;r</i> (Asses&rsquo; Hill) we alighted in
D&euml;&acirc;b&rsquo;s own camp, not large in extent or number of people,
probably only a small detachment from the main body brought with him for
the occasion, but not such, or so placed, as to interfere with the camp of
&rsquo;Abdul &rsquo;Azeez.&nbsp; However, the well-known emblems of the
Shaikh&rsquo;s presence were observed&mdash;namely, his tent being placed
at the west end of the line, and his spear at its entrance.&nbsp; Here took
place the formality of returning his visit to us yesterday; and here, after
coffee and pipes, our presents were produced and given.&nbsp; The
travellers were collected in a very long black tent, together with
D&euml;&acirc;b, his son and friends.&nbsp; A screen at one end divided us
from the women&rsquo;s apartment, <i>i.e.</i>, what would be the
<i>Hhareem</i> in houses of towns; behind this curtain the women were
peeping, chattering, and laughing; of course we might expect this to be
about the extraordinary-looking strangers.&nbsp; It has been conjectured
that such a separation of the tent is implied in <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Gen. xviii. 6 and 10,
when &ldquo;Sarah heard it in the tent-door which was behind him;&rdquo;
but this has no foundation in the plain narrative of Scripture, only in the
Arabic translation the words seem to imply that understanding.</p>
<p>The presentation of offerings was a grave and solemn affair.&nbsp; Each
donor produced his tribute with an apology for the insignificance of the
gift, which was then exhibited in silence by an attendant to the populace
of the tribe crowding outside.</p>
<p>The ceremony was concluded by shouts of welcome, and a huge meal of
pilaff (rice and mutton upon a great tray of tinned copper) and
l&eacute;ban, (curdled milk,) with more smoking.&nbsp; Here we took leave
of the chief, who sent on a detachment of his tribe to escort us for the
rest of our expedition.</p>
<p>Remounted, and proceeded N.E. by N.; hitherto we had come due north from
Heshbon.&nbsp; Passed a hill called <i>Jeh&acirc;arah</i>, and in a short
time reached the source of the river of Ammon, rising out of the ground,
with a large pavement of masonry near it.&nbsp; A numerous flock of sheep
and goats were being watered at the spring, it being near the time of
As&rsquo;r&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Here the antiquities of <i>Amm&acirc;n</i> commenced; and remains of
considerable buildings continually solicited our attention, as we passed on
for quarter of an hour more to our tents, which we found <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>already pitched and
waiting for us among a crowd of ancient temples and baths and
porticoes,&mdash;in a forum between a line of eight large Corinthian
columns and the small river; in front too of a Roman theatre in good
condition.&nbsp; Some of the party, who were familiar with the ruins of
Rome and Athens, exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;What would the modern Romans give
to have so much to show as this, within a similar space!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Saturday afternoon; and we had already resolved to spend our
Sabbath in this wonderful and agreeable place, so remarkable in Scripture
history, and so seldom visited by Europeans.</p>
<p>I climbed up the seats of the theatre, and rested near the top, enjoying
the grand spectacle of luxurious architecture around; then descended, and
walked along its proscenium; but neither reciting passages of Euripides nor
of Terence, as some enthusiasts might indulge themselves in doing, before
an imagined audience of tetrarchs, centurions, or legionaries, or other</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Romanos rerum dominos, gentemque togatam.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close to this theatre was a covered and sumptuous building, which I
could not but suppose to be a naumachia, from its having rising rows of
seats around the central space, with a channel leading into this from the
river.&nbsp; As the shadows of evening lengthened, the heat of the day was
moderated, <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>and I sauntered along the bank of the stream till I came to a
large headless statue of a female figure lying in the water.&nbsp; Some men
lifted it upon the green bank for me; but it was far too heavy to be
transported to Jerusalem for the Literary Society&rsquo;s Museum.</p>
<p>The swift-flowing rivulet abounded in fish, some of which the Arabs
killed for us, either by throwing stones or shooting them with bullets,
having no other means of getting at them; but the latter of these methods
was too costly to be often adopted.&nbsp; However, we had some fish for
dinner in &ldquo;Rabbah, the city of waters.&rdquo;&nbsp; This stream is
the commencement of the Zerka, which we were to meet afterwards, after its
course hence N.E. and then N.W.</p>
<p>I feasted a dozen Arabs at my tent-door.&nbsp; Shaikh &rsquo;Abdul
&rsquo;Azeez laughed when I remarked that this place was better worth
seeing than Heshbon, and said, &ldquo;This is a king&rsquo;s city.&nbsp; It
was the city of King <i>Gheday&ucirc;s</i>; and Jerash, which is still more
splendid, was built by <i>Shedd&acirc;d</i>, of the primitive race of the
<i>Beni &rsquo;Ad</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond this, of course, it was
impossible for him to imagine anything in matters of antiquity.</p>
<p>In my evening&rsquo;s Scripture reading, I was much struck with the
opening of the 65th Psalm: &ldquo;Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in
Zion,&rdquo;&mdash;which passes over all the examples of human achievement
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>elsewhere, in order to celebrate the peculiar and undying honours
of Jerusalem.&nbsp; So now the Grecian and the Roman colonies, who erected
the marvels of architecture around me, are gone; while the Jewish people,
the Hebrew language, the city of Jerusalem, and the Bible revelations of
mercy from God to man, continue for ever.&nbsp; But most particularly does
this psalm, taken with the circumstances there before our eyes, point out
the difference made between Ammon and Israel, and the reason for it, as
predicted in Ezek. xxv., 1-7:&mdash;&ldquo;The word of the Lord came again
unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and
prophesy against them; and say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the
Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my
sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it
was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into
captivity; behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for
a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their
dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy
milk.&nbsp; And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
couching-place for flocks; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.&nbsp; For
thus saith the Lord God; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped
with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>all thy despite against
the land of Israel; behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon
thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee
off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries:
I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Dew on the grass; but it was the
morning dew, which, like human goodness, was soon exhaled.</p>
<p>After meditating on the chapters in Numbers and Deuteronomy which refer
to the conduct and destinies of Ammon and Moab, and reading Jer. xlviii.
and xlix. within &ldquo;the flowing valley&rdquo; of the 4th verse of the
latter, I was summoned to divine service in a tent fitted up for the
purpose,&mdash;carpets on the floor &ldquo;honoris caus&acirc;;&rdquo; a
table covered with simple white, and a serious congregation of Englishmen
before it, each with his own Bible and prayer-book.&nbsp; Thank God that to
carry such books about in the wildest deserts is a characteristic of my
countrymen!</p>
<p>This city of <i>&rsquo;Amm&acirc;n</i> is &ldquo;the city in the midst
of the river&rdquo; of Joshua xiii. 9; and &ldquo;Rabbah of the children of
Ammon&rdquo;&mdash;the royal city&mdash;&ldquo;the city of waters&rdquo; of
2 Sam. xii. 26, 27:&mdash;to the siege of which Joab invited King David,
&ldquo;lest he should take it, and it should be called after his
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was also deposited the huge iron bedstead of Og,
king of Bashan.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Under the Ptolemy dynasty&mdash;successors of Alexander&mdash;it
was rebuilt, with the name of Philadelphia.&nbsp; Several of the best
edifices here, now partially ruined, belong to that period.</p>
<p>Under the Crusaders it was a flourishing city and district, retaining
the Grecian name.</p>
<p>I could not but reflect on the infinite prescience that dictated the
prophecies of the Bible&mdash;no tongue could speak more plainly to us than
the scene around us did, the fulfilment of the denunciations that these
cities of Moab and Ammon should remain <i>as cities</i> &ldquo;without
inhabitants&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not a man to dwell therein&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;driven out every man, right forth, and none shall gather up him that
wandereth&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;desolate&rdquo; and &ldquo;most
desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon we walked about to inspect the antiquities, and found
several remains of Christian churches with bell-towers attached to
them&mdash;certainly not originally minarets.&nbsp; These edifices had been
afterwards, in Mohammedan times, converted into mosques, as evidenced by
the niche made in the south wall of each, pointing to Mecca; and there are
watch-towers for signals on all the summits of hills around.&nbsp; The city
lies nestled in a valley between these hills.</p>
<p>The first building I examined was among those of the citadel placed upon
a lofty eminence <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>commanding the city, the ground-plan of which
building is here shown&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p30.jpg">
<img alt="Ground-plan of possible old church" src="images/p30.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The interior of the walls was so profusely embellished with festoons of
roses and vine-grapes&mdash;both sculptured in stone and wrought in stucco,
and of very large size&mdash;that there was no room left for pictures or
images.&nbsp; The roof of this building is almost all fallen in.&nbsp; I
imagined this to have been a Christian church, of very remote <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>antiquity, on
account of the vine and the roses, which are peculiarly Christian
symbols&mdash;alluding to the texts, &ldquo;I am the true Vine,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I am the Rose of Sharon;&rdquo; but the chambers in each corner are
difficult to account for.&nbsp; The east and west ends have no doors.</p>
<p>Near this is a square mass of masonry, upon which are standing six
columns, of magnificent dimensions, which no doubt originally supported a
roof.&nbsp; Their capitals, of chaste and correct Corinthian style, with
portions of ornamental entablature, are lying near.&nbsp; Perhaps belonging
to this, but at some distance, lies a ponderous piece of architrave, on
which, between lines of moulding, is an inscription in
Greek&mdash;illegible except the three
letters&mdash;&Nu;&Omega;&Theta;.&nbsp; These letters were nine inches in
length.</p>
<p>Nigh to this, again, was a square building of rabbeted stones, equal to
almost the largest in the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>All down the hill, descending to our camp, were fragments of columns and
of decorated friezes of temples, that had evidently been rolled or had
slidden down from their places.</p>
<p>Upon various walls of dilapidated edifices I observed the curious marks,
slightly scratched, which almost resemble alphabetical characters, but are
not; and which have, wherever met with and wherever noticed, which is but
seldom, puzzled <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>travellers, however learned, to decipher.&nbsp;
I copied the following:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p32a.jpg">
<img alt="Bedaween Arab token 1" src="images/p32a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And from the shaft of a column still erect, half way down the hill, I
copied the following:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p32b.jpg">
<img alt="Bedaween Arab token 2" src="images/p32b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I have since learned that they are the tokens of the Bedaween Arabs, by
which one tribe is <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>distinguished from another.&nbsp; In common
parlance they are called the <i>Ausam</i> (plural of Wasam) of the several
tribes. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p>In a valley to the north of us, leading westwards from the main valley,
we found a beautiful mausoleum tomb,&mdash;a building, not an excavation in
rock,&mdash;containing six sarcophagi, or ornamented stone coffins, ranged
upon ledges of masonry, along three sides of the chamber.&nbsp; These were
very large, and all of the same pattern&mdash;the lids remaining upon some
of them, but shifted aside.&nbsp; Beautiful sculptured embellishments were
upon the inside walls and over the portal outside, but no inscriptions to
indicate the period or persons to whom they belonged.&nbsp; Inside,
however, were rudely scratched the modern Arab tribe-signs, showing that
persons of such tribes had visited there; so that Europeans are not the
only travellers who help to disfigure ancient monuments by
scribbling.&nbsp; Along this western valley were several other such
mausoleums.&nbsp; Thence we mounted on a different side to the summit of
that hill from which I have here begun my description of
edifices&mdash;upon a gentle sloping road, evidently of artificial cutting,
quite feasible for ascent of chariots.</p>
<p>Near the square (possible) church before mentioned, (though I should say
that our party were not all convinced of its being a church,) is a
prodigiously large cistern, of good masonry.&nbsp; From the top of the
strong walls of the building&mdash;while <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>some Arab boys below me
were reaching birds&rsquo; nests&mdash;I got from our guide the following
list of sites in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; They were of course unable to
discriminate between ancient and modern names; and I do not find one Bible

<p>The people informed me of a place, a little nearer than Kerak, called
<i>Rabbah</i>.&nbsp; This latter may be a <i>Rabbath-Moab</i>.</p>
<p>I have no further notes to transcribe respecting the architectural
remains; but they are so numerous and so important that a week would not
suffice for their thorough investigation.&nbsp; All our party were highly
gratified at having visited this Rabbath-Ammon&mdash;<i>alias</i>
Philadelphia&mdash;<i>alias</i>, at present, &rsquo;Amm&acirc;n.&nbsp; We
were not, however, so fortunate as Lord Lindsay in finding a fulfilment of
the prophecy (Ezek. xxv. 5) with respect to camels, either alive or
dead.&nbsp; Probably, when he was there, it <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>was soon after an
Egyptian military expedition to Kerak.&nbsp; The prodigious number of dead
camels that he saw there would seem to indicate that a great Arab battle
had been fought at that place shortly before.&nbsp; It is only in this way
that we could account for a cannonball (about a six-pounder) which one of
the boys carried about, in following us, all the afternoon, wishing us to
buy it of him as a curiosity.</p>
<p>On returning to the tents, I found an old Jerusalem acquaintance&mdash;a
Moslem named &rsquo;Abderrahhman Bek el &rsquo;Asali&mdash;and with him
several people from Es-Salt; among these a Christian named Abb&acirc;s.</p>
<p>From conversation with them I got some fresh information on Arab
affairs.&nbsp; These people took the opportunity of glorifying their native
town; related how they are frequently at war, and that successfully, with
the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n; and when acting in concert with the Abb&acirc;d, or
much more so when in alliance with the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r, can always repel
them; only it happens that sometimes the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n get help from
the more distant &rsquo;Anezeh; and this is much more than enough to turn
the balance again.&nbsp; But even now the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n cannot come
near the town; neither can they quite forget that the Saltiyeh people,
during a former war, killed both the father and grandfather of
D&euml;&acirc;b, and sent the head of the former to the tribe in a dish,
with a pilaff of rice.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>All the strength of the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n now lies in Shaikh
D&euml;&acirc;b, with his son &rsquo;Ali, (who came to welcome us near the
Jordan,) and Gubl&acirc;n the nephew.&nbsp; Old &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l
&rsquo;Azeez is considered childish, and unfit to lead them.</p>
<p>For us travellers, however, the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n are sufficient.&nbsp;
The territory is theirs over which we are passing, and they do all they can
to please us; only, of course, like all Arab guides, they take every
opportunity of insinuating themselves into being fed by us, which is a
condition &ldquo;not in the bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a visit of three men with good-natured countenances.&nbsp;
These were Bedawi minstrels from Tadmor, (Palmyra,) who wander about from
tribe to tribe, singing heroic poems to the accompaniment of their
reb&acirc;beh, (a very primitive sort of fiddle.)&nbsp; No warfare
interferes with the immunity of their persons or property.&nbsp; They are
never injured or insulted, but are always and everywhere welcome, and
liberally rewarded.&nbsp; Of course it is for their interest to gratify the
pride of their auditors by fervid appeals to their ancestral renown, or to
individual prowess and generosity.</p>
<p>The Arabic of their chants is unintelligible to towns-people; it is the
high classic language of Antar.</p>
<p>I had made acquaintance with these same men before at Tibneen Castle,
near the Lebanon, during a season of Bairam.&nbsp; Being Sunday, we
requested them to visit our tents in the morning.&nbsp; Our Arabs, <!--
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>however,
and the dragomans kept them singing till a late hour round the fires
lighted among the tents.&nbsp; It was a cheerful scene, in the clear
starlight, and the lustrous planet Venus reflected in the running
stream.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;After breakfast, and an entertainment
of music from our troubadours, and the bestowing of our guerdon, these left
us on their way to the other camp at Na&rsquo;oor; and our packing up
commenced.</p>
<p>Strange medley of costumes and languages among the grand
colonnades.&nbsp; Our Arabs left us, having the luggage in charge, and
indicating to us the camping-ground where we were to meet again at
night&mdash;thus leaving us in care of the Salt&icirc;yeh friends of ours,
who were to escort us to their town and its neighbourhood, as the
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n might not go there themselves.</p>
<p>Both the Christian and Moslem shaikhs of the town came to meet us on the
way.&nbsp; The former was a very old man; and he could with difficulty be
persuaded to mount his donkey in presence of a train so majestic, in his
eyes, coming from the holy city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We passed an encampment of <i>Beni Hhasan</i>.&nbsp; These people are
few in number, and exist under the shadow of the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n.</p>
<p>There were plenty of locusts about the country; but we soon came to a
vast space of land covered with storks, so numerous as completely to hide
<!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the
face of the earth, all of them busily employed in feeding&mdash;of course
devouring the locusts.&nbsp; So great is the blessing derived from the
visits of storks, that the natives of these countries regard it as a sin to
destroy the birds.&nbsp; On our riding among them they rose in the air,
entirely obscuring he sky and the sun from our view.&nbsp; One of our party
attempted to fire among them with his revolver, but, by some heedlessness
or accident, the bunch of barrels, being not well screwed down flew off the
stock and was lost for a time; it took more than half an hour&rsquo;s
search by all of us to find it again, and the Arabs considered this a just
punishment for wishing to kill such useful creatures.</p>
<p>We traversed a meadow where Shaikh Faisel, with a detachment of the
&rsquo;Anezeh, had encamped for pasture, and only left it thirty-five days
before.&nbsp; His flocks and herds were described to us as impossible to be
counted; but our friends were unanimous in stating that his camels were
1500 in number.</p>
<p>Came to <i>Khirbet es Sar</i>, (<i>Jazer</i>?) whence the Dead Sea was
again visible.&nbsp; Our Arabs declared that they could distinguish the
Frank mountain, and see into the streets of Bethlehem.&nbsp; Here there is
a mere heap of ruin, with cisterns, and fragments of arches, large columns,
and capitals; also a very rough cyclopean square building of brown striped
flint in huge masses.</p>
<p>This site is three hours due north of Na&rsquo;oor, in <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>a straight line, not
turning aside to D&euml;&acirc;b&rsquo;s camp or &rsquo;Amm&acirc;n.&nbsp;
Northwards hence are the well-wooded hills of <i>&rsquo;Ajloon</i>.&nbsp;
To my inquiries for any site with a name resembling Nebo, I was referred to
the <i>Neba</i>, half an hour south of Heshbon, which is given in the list
taken down by me at Heshbon.</p>
<p>Proceeding northwards, we had the hills of <i>Jebel M&acirc;has</i>
parallel on our right hand; and to our left, in a deep glen below, was the
source of the stream Se&rsquo;eer, which had flowed past us at
<i>Cuferain</i>, our first encampment after crossing the Jordan.</p>
<p>Arrived at the ruined town (modern in appearance) of <i>Dabook</i>, from
whence they say the <i>Dabookeh</i> grapes at Hebron <a
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> had
their origin; but there are none to be seen here now (see Jer. xlviii. 32,
33)&mdash;&ldquo;O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of
Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage.&nbsp; And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and
from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the
wine-presses,&rdquo; etc.: with nearly the same words in Isa. xvi.
8-10.</p>
<p>At a short distance upon our right was a ruined village called
<i>Khuldah</i>.&nbsp; This was at the entrance of woods of the evergreen
oak, with hawthorn, many trees of each kind twined round with
honeysuckle.&nbsp; There Shaikh Yusuf, (the Moslem of Es-Salt,) who is a
fine singer, entertained us with his <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>performances, often
bursting into extemporaneous verses suitable to the occasion and
company.</p>
<p>On reaching an exceedingly stony and desolate place, he related the
original story of Lokman the miser, connected with
it:&mdash;&ldquo;Formerly this was a fertile and lovely spot, abounding in
gardens of fruit; and as the Apostle Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon
him!) was passing by, he asked for some of the delicious produce for his
refreshment on the weary way, but the churlish owner Lokman denied him the
proper hospitality, and even used insulting language to the unknown
traveller, (far be it from us!)&nbsp; Whereupon the latter, who was aware
beforehand of the man&rsquo;s character, and knew that he was hopelessly
beyond the reach of exhortation and of wise instruction, invoked upon him,
by the spirit of prophecy, the curse of God, (the almighty and
glorious.)&nbsp; And so his gardens were converted into these barren rocks
before us, and the fruit into mere stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the tale.&nbsp; But similar miraculous punishments for
inhospitality are told at Mount Carmel, as inflicted by the Prophet Elijah;
and near Bethlehem by the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>From a distance we caught a distant view of the <i>Beka&rsquo; el
Basha</i>, or Pasha&rsquo;s meadow, where we were to encamp at night, but
turned aside westwards in order to visit the town of Es-Salt.&nbsp; Upon a
wide level tract we came to a small patch of ground enclosed by a low wall,
to which a space was left for entrance, <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>with a lintel thrown
across it, but still not above four feet from ground.&nbsp; On this were
bits of glass and beads and pebbles deposited, as votive offerings, or
tokens of remembrance or respect.&nbsp; The place is called the Weli, or
tomb, of a Persian Moslem saint named <i>Sardoni</i>.&nbsp; But it should
be recollected that in Arabic the name <i>&rsquo;Ajam</i>, or Persia, is
often used to signify any unknown distant country to the east.</p>
<p>At <i>&rsquo;Ain el Jadoor</i> we found water springing out of the
rocks, among vineyards and fig and walnut trees, olives also, and
pomegranates&mdash;a beautiful oasis, redeemed from the devastation of
Bedaween by the strong hand of the town population.&nbsp; Near this the
Christian Shaikh Abb&acirc;s, being in our company, was met by his
venerable mother and his son Bakhi.</p>
<p>In every direction the town of Es-Salt is environed by fruitful gardens,
the produce of which finds a market in Nabloos and Jerusalem.&nbsp; The
scenery reminded me of the Lebanon in its green aspect of industry and
wealth.</p>
<p>Entering the town we dismounted at the house of Shaikh Yusuf, and took
our refreshment on the open terrace, on the shady side of a wall.</p>
<p>Some of us walked about and visited the two Christian churches: they are
both named &ldquo;St George,&rdquo; and are very poor in furniture.&nbsp;
Of course they have over the door the universal picture in these countries
of St George on his prancing gray horse.&nbsp; This obtains for them some
respect from the <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Mohammedans, who also revere that martial and
religious hero.&nbsp; Inside the churches we found some pictures with
Russian writing upon the frames; the people informed us that these were
presents from the Emperor Nicholas, which is worthy of notice.</p>
<p>The ignorance of the priests here is proverbial all over
Palestine.&nbsp; I have heard it told of them as a common practice, that
they recite the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the <i>Fathhah</i>, or opening
chapter of the Koran, alternately, on the ground that these are both very
sublime and beautiful; and it is said that they baptize in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; There is reason to
believe them very grossly ignorant; but it may be that some of these
reports about them emanate from the Roman Catholic authorities in
Jerusalem, who never hesitate at propagating slanders to the detriment of
non-Romanists.</p>
<p>In a church porch I found a school of dirty ragged children reading the
Psalms from the small English printed edition; not, however, learning to
read by means of the alphabet or spelling, but learning to know the forms
of words by rote; boys and girls together, all very slightly dressed, and
one of the boys stark naked.</p>
<p>People came to me to be cured of ophthalmia.&nbsp; I got out of my
portmanteau for them some sugar of lead; but it is inconceivable the
difficulty I had to get a vessel for making it into a lotion&mdash;bottles
or phials were totally unknown, not even cups were to <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>be procured.&nbsp; At
one time I thought of a gourd-shell, but there was not one <i>dried</i> in
the town; so they told me.&nbsp; I might have lent them my drinking-cup,
but then I wanted to prepare a large quantity to be left behind and to be
used occasionally.&nbsp; I forget now what was the expedient adopted, but I
think it was the last named-one, but of course only making sufficient for
immediate use.&nbsp; I left a quantity behind me in powder, with directions
to dilute it considerably whenever any vessel could be found; warning the
people, however, of its poisonous nature if taken by mouth.</p>
<p>One man came imploring me to cure him of deafness, but I could not
undertake his case.&nbsp; In any of those countries a medical missionary
would be of incalculable benefit to the people.</p>
<p>There are ancient remains about the town, but not considerable in any
respect.&nbsp; It is often taken for granted that this is the Ramoth-Gilead
of Scripture, but I believe without any other reason than that, from the
copious springs of water, there must always have been an important city
there.&nbsp; The old name, however, would rather lead us north-eastwards to
the hills of <i>Jela&rsquo;ad</i>, where there are also springs and
ruins.</p>
<p>On leaving the town we experienced a good deal of annoyance from the
Moslem population, one of whom stole a gun from a gentleman of the party,
and when detected, for a long time refused to give it up.&nbsp; Of course,
in the end it was returned; but <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>I was told afterwards that the people had a
notion that we ought to pay them something for visiting their town, just as
we pay the wild Arabs for visiting Jerash.&nbsp; What a difference from the
time of the strong Egyptian Government when Lord Lindsay was there!</p>
<p>At a distance of perhaps half or three-quarters of an hour there is a
<i>Weli</i> called <i>Nebi Osha</i>; that is to say, a sepulchre, or
commemorative station of the Prophet Joshua, celebrated all over the
country for the exceeding magnificence of the prospect it commands in every
direction.&nbsp; In order to reach this, we had to pass over hills and
plains newly taken into cultivation for vineyards, mile after mile, in
order to supply a recent call for the peculiar grapes of the district at
Jerusalem to be sent to London as raisins.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Weli, we found no language sufficient to express the
astonishment elicited by the view before us; and here it will be safest
only to indicate the salient points of the extensive landscape, without
indulging in the use of epithets vainly striving to portray our
feelings.&nbsp; We were looking over the Gh&ocirc;r, with the Jordan
sparkling in the sunshine upon its winding course below.&nbsp; In direct
front was <i>Nabloos</i>, lying between Ebal and Gerizim; while at the same
time we could distinguish Neby Samwil near Jerusalem, the Mount Tabor,
Mount Carmel, and part of the Lebanon all at once!&nbsp; On our own side of
Jordan we saw the extensive remains <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of <i>Kala&rsquo;at
Rubb&acirc;d</i>, and ruins of a town called <i>Mais&#277;ra</i>.&nbsp; On
such a spot what could we do but lie in the shade of the whitewashed Weli,
under gigantic oak-trees, and gaze and ponder and wish in
silence,&mdash;ay, and pray and praise too,&mdash;looking back through the
vista of thirty-three centuries to the time of the longing of Moses, the
&ldquo;man of God,&rdquo; expressed in these words &ldquo;O Lord God, Thou
hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness and Thy mighty hand: . .
.&nbsp; I pray Thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond
Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The honoured leader
of His people&mdash;the long-tried man &ldquo;through good report and evil
report,&rdquo; who, during his second forty years which he spent as a
shepherd in Midian, had been accustomed to the abstemious habits and keen
eyesight of the desert; and, at the end of another forty years as the ruler
of a whole nation, living in the desert, &ldquo;his eye was not
dim,&rdquo;&mdash;added to which natural advantage, we are told that
&ldquo;the Lord showed him all the land,&rdquo; highly cultivated as it was
then by seven nations greater and mightier than Israel,&mdash;Moses must
have beheld a spectacle from Pisgah and Nebo, surpassing even the glories
of this landscape viewed by us from Nebi Osha.</p>
<p>Turning eastwards to our evening home, we passed a ruined site called
<i>Berga&rsquo;an</i>, where we had one more view of the Dead Sea, and
traversed large plains of ripe corn, belonging, of course, to the people of
Es-Salt.&nbsp; The people requested me to <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>pray to God that the
locusts might not come there, since all that harvest was destined for
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We met some of the <i>&rsquo;Abb&acirc;d Kattaleen</i> Arabs, but we
were safe under the escort of the Salt&icirc;yeh instead of the
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n.&nbsp; These &rsquo;Abb&acirc;d are the people who
assaulted and plundered some seamen of H.M.S. &ldquo;Spartan&rdquo; in
1847, on the Jordan; for which offence they have never yet been chastised,
notwithstanding the urgent applications made to the Turkish Pashas of
Jerusalem, Bayroot, and Damascus.&nbsp; We did not arrive at the encampment
till long after dark, and there was no moonlight.</p>
<p>The site is on a plain encircled by hills, with plenty of water
intersecting the ground; the small streams are bordered by reeds and long
grass.&nbsp; A khan, now in ruin, is situated in the midst&mdash;a locality
certainly deserving its name, <i>Beka&rsquo; el Bash&agrave;</i>, and is
said to have been a favourite camping-station for the Pashas of Damascus in
former times.</p>
<p>Much to our vexation, the Arabs and the muleteers had pitched our tents
in a slovenly manner among the winding water-courses, so that we had wet
reeds, thistles, and long grass, beetles and grasshoppers inside the tents,
which again were wetted outside with heavy dew.&nbsp; They had done this in
order to keep the cattle immediately close to us, and therefore as free
from forayers as possible during the night.&nbsp; Such was the reason
assigned, and we were all too hungry and tired to argue the matter
further.</p>
<p>My people complained to me of the insolence of <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the Salt&icirc;yeh
guides that were with us; so I sent for the two shaikhs and scolded
them.&nbsp; They persisted in it that they did not deserve the rebuke, that
the complaints ought to be laid against a certain farrier who had come over
from Jerusalem, etc., etc.&nbsp; My servant ended the affair by shouting at
them, &ldquo;Take my last word with you and feed upon it&mdash;&lsquo;God
send you a strong government.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This at least they
deserved, for they are often in arms against the Turkish government: and
although so prosperous in trade and agriculture, are many years in arrear
with their taxes.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Early in the morning there were
Salt&icirc;yeh people reaping harvest near us, chiefly in the Christian
fields; for here the case is not as in Palestine, where Christians
generally sow and reap in partnership with Moslems, for their own safety;
but the Moslems have their fields, and the Christians have theirs apart,
which shows that their influence is more considerable here; indeed, the
Christians carry arms, and go out to war against the Bedaween, quite like
the Moslems.</p>
<p>Before we left, the day was becoming exceedingly hot, and we had six
hours&rsquo; march before us to Jerash.</p>
<p>The hills abound with springs of water.&nbsp; We passed one called
<i>Umm el &rsquo;Egher</i>, another called <i>Safoot</i>, also <i>Abu
Mus-hhaf</i>, and <i>T&acirc;bakra</i>, and <i>&rsquo;Ain Umm ed
Dumaneer</i>, with a ruin named <i>Khirbet Saleekhi</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>The &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n Arabs were now again our guides, the
Salt&icirc;yeh having returned home; but for some distance the guides were
few and without firearms, only armed with spears, and the common peasant
sword called <i>khanjar</i>; perhaps this was by compact with the
Salt&icirc;yeh, as in about an hour&rsquo;s time we were joined by a
reinforcement with a few matchlock guns.&nbsp; On we went through
corn-fields, which are sown in joint partnership with the Arabs and the
Moslems of the town; then doubled round a long and high hill with a ruin on
it, called <i>Jela&rsquo;ad</i>.&nbsp; This I have since suspected to be
Ramoth-Gilead.&nbsp; We descended a hill called <i>Tallooz</i>; forward
again between hills and rocks, and neglected evergreen woods, upon narrow
paths.&nbsp; A numerous caravan we were, with a hundred animals of burden,
bright costumes, and cheerful conversation, till we reached a large
terebinth-tree under a hill called <i>Shebail</i>; the site is called
<i>Thuggeret el Mogh&acirc;fer</i>, signifying a &ldquo;look-out
station&rdquo; between two tribes.&nbsp; There we rested a while, till the
above-mentioned reinforcement joined us.&nbsp; From this spot we could just
discern <i>Jerash</i>, on the summit of a huge hill before us.</p>
<p>We now had one long and continued descent to the river Zerka.&nbsp;
Passed through a defile, on issuing from which we observed a little stream
with oleander, in pink blossom, thirty feet high, and in great
abundance.&nbsp; Halted again at a pretty spring, called
<i>Rum&acirc;n</i>, where the water was upon nearly a dead level, and
therefore scarcely moving; then <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>another small spring, called <i>Bursa</i>, and
also <i>&rsquo;Ain el Merubb&rsquo;a&rsquo;</i>.</p>
<p>Evergreen oak in all directions, but with broader leaf than in
Palestine; also some terebinth-trees and wild holly-oaks.&nbsp; All the
scenery now expanded before us in width and height and depth.</p>
<p>We took notice of several high hills with groves of evergreen oak on
their summits; detached hills, which we could not but consider as remains
of the ancient <i>high places</i> for idolatrous worship.</p>
<p>Still descended, till on a sudden turn of the road came the rushing of
the <i>Zerka</i>, or Jabbok, water upon our ears, with a breeze sighing
among juniper-bushes, and enormous and gorgeous oleanders, together with
the soft zephyr feeling from the stream upon our heated faces&mdash;oh, so
inexpressibly delicious!&nbsp; I was the first to get across, and on
reaching the opposite bank we all dismounted, to drink freely from the
river&mdash;a name which it deserves as at that place it is about
two-thirds of the width of the Jordan at the usual visiting-place for
travellers.</p>
<p>Some of the party went bathing.&nbsp; We all had our several luncheons,
some smoked, all got into shady nooks by the water-side; and I, with my
heart full, lay meditating on the journey we had hitherto made.</p>
<p>At length I had been permitted by God&rsquo;s good providence to
traverse the territory of Moses and the chosen people antecedent to the
writing of the <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Pentateuch, when they were warring upon Ammon and Moab.&nbsp; How
solemn are the sensations derived from pondering upon periods of such very
hoar antiquity&mdash;a time when the deliverance at the Red Sea, the
thunders of Sinai, the rebellion of Korah and Dathan, the erection of the
tabernacle, and the death of Aaron, were still fresh in the memories of
living witnesses; and the manna was still their food from heaven,
notwithstanding the supplies from the cultivated country they were passing
through, (Josh. v. 12.)&nbsp; Elisha did well in after times on the banks
of Jordan, when he cried out, &ldquo;Where is the Lord God of
Elijah?&rdquo;&nbsp; And we may exclaim, in contemplation of these
marvellous events of the still more remote ages, &ldquo;Where is the Lord
God of Moses, who with a mighty hand and stretched-out
arm&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;redeemed His people from their enemies; for His
mercy endureth for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nations and generations may rise and
pass away; phases of dominion and civilisation may vary under Assyrian,
Egyptian, Hellenic, and Roman forms, or under our modern modifications; yet
all this is transitory.&nbsp; The God of creation, providence, and grace,
He lives and abides for ever.&nbsp; His power is still great as in the days
of old, His wisdom unsearchable, and His goodness infinite.&nbsp; Ay, and
this dispenser of kingdoms is also the guide of the humble in heart, and He
cares for the smallest concerns of individual persons who rest upon
Him.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Strengthened by these and similar reflections, with ardent
aspirations for the future, I rose up and pursued my journey, as
Bunyan&rsquo;s pilgrim might have done, under the heartfelt assurance that
&ldquo;happy is he that hath the God of <i>Jacob</i> for his
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were now leaving behind us much of the Old Testament
country&mdash;not exclusively that of the Mosaic era, but the land which
had been trodden by the patriarchs Abraham and Israel on their several
removals from Padan-aram to Canaan.&nbsp; But, while looking back upon the
grand landscape outline with an intense degree of interest, it may be well
to remark that, among all our company, there was a feeling of uncertainty
as to the geographical boundaries of the lands possessed by the old people
of Ammon, Moab, and Bashan.&nbsp; Probably there had been some fluctuations
of their towns and confines between the time of the exodus and the
prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah.</p>
<p>One thing is certain&mdash;that we all, with one heart, were confident
that God spake by Moses and the prophets; and that, with the incidents, the
people and the local names we had lately passed among, we might as soon
believe in the non-existence of the sun and stars, as that the books called
&ldquo;The Law of Moses&rdquo; are not in every word a record of infallible
truth.</p>
<p>We had now a different journey, and a different <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>set of scenes before
us, entering into the half tribe of Manasseh.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p52.jpg">
<img alt="Triumphal Arch" src="images/p52.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Ascending the steep mountain-sides with two of the guides, I preceded
the rest of the party, and even the baggage mules.&nbsp; In perhaps half an
hour, (it may be more,) I came to a triumphal arch, the commencement of
Jerash.&nbsp; One of the guides told me that they call this the Amm&acirc;n
Gate of the old city; for that, in ancient times, there were two <!-- page
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>brothers, one
named Amm&acirc;n, and the other Jerash.&nbsp; Each of them built a city,
and gave it his own name; but called the gate nearest to his
brother&rsquo;s city, by the name of that brother.</p>
<p>At this gateway I observed the anomaly of the columns on each side of
the principal opening, having their capitals at the bottom of the shafts,
and resting on the pediments, though in an upright position.&nbsp; It was
very ridiculous.&nbsp; When could this have been done&mdash;at the original
erection of the gate, or at a later rebuilding, after an earthquake had
shaken the pillars?&nbsp; It would seem to me to be the former, as they are
posted against the wall, and this is not disturbed or altered.&nbsp; The
columns and the curve of the portal are gone, so that it cannot be seen
whether originally they had capitals on the heads also of the
columns.&nbsp; It is most probable that those remaining are not the true
capitals, inasmuch as they have no volutes.</p>
<p>Passing by inferior monuments of antiquity,&mdash;such as a sepulchre, a
single column, a sarcophagus, and then a square elevated pavement in good
condition, upon which are several sarcophagi, some of them broken, and all
with the lids displaced,&mdash;I came to a large circus of Ionic columns,
almost all standing, and joined to each other at the top by
architraves.&nbsp; Thence holding on the same direction forwards due north,
our way was between a double row of grand Corinthian columns with their
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>capitals, and occasional temples to the right and left.&nbsp; At
the termination of this, but without continuing the same line, between
columns of another Grecian order, I turned aside, at a vast Roman bath, to
a spring of water, the commencement of a running stream, in a small meadow
of tall grass and thorns, intending to pitch my tent there; but soon
changed my mind, and got myself established within a wing of the Roman
bath, which stood on higher ground, and had a good roof upon it.</p>
<p>The other gentlemen on coming up, adopted the choice of their dragomans
and muleteers, near the water, after having the thorns and thistles cleared
away.&nbsp; A fresh afternoon breeze that sprang up was peculiarly grateful
to men and cattle.</p>
<p>After some rest, I proceeded to stroll about,&mdash;first of all to the
great Temple of the Sun, on a rising ground to the west of the great
colonnade, which, besides the columns along all the sides of the edifice,
has a conspicuous portico in front, consisting of twelve magnificent
Corinthian columns, a few of which are fallen.&nbsp; Thence I walked to the
Naumachia, near the southern extremity of the city, (that by which we had
arrived,) and found this in good condition, with the seats remaining, and
the channel well defined which conveyed water for the exhibitions from the
above-mentioned spring.&nbsp; The form is a long oval, flattened at one
end.</p>
<p>In passing once more between the double line of Corinthian columns, I
counted fifty-five of them <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>standing, besides fragments and capitals of the
missing ones lying on the ground.</p>
<p>From this I diverged at right angles, through a street of small public
buildings, towards the bridge over the stream, (and this I called Bridge
Street&mdash;part of the pavement still remains, consisting of long slabs
laid across the whole width from house to house;) then upon the bridge, as
far as its broken condition would allow, and returned to my
home&mdash;everywhere among scattered fragments of entablature; numerous
altars entire, and sculptured with garlands; also broken buildings, with
niches embellished inside with sculptured ornament.&nbsp; In all my
exploration, however, I found no statues or fragments of statues&mdash;the
Mohammedan iconoclasts had long ago destroyed all these; but there were
some remains of inscriptions, much defaced or worn away by the work of
time.</p>
<p>The natural agencies by which the edifices have come to ruin seem to
be&mdash;first, earthquakes; then the growth of weeds, thorns, and even
trees, between the courses of stone, after the population ceased; or rain
and snow detaching small pieces, which were followed by larger; also
sometimes a sinking of the ground; and besides these common causes of
decay, there comes the great destroyer&mdash;man.</p>
<p>Yet nature is always picturesque, even after the demolition of the works
of human art or genius; and it is pleasing to see the tendrils, leaves, and
scarlet berries of the nightshade playfully twining <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>among the sculptured
friezes which are scattered about in every position but straight lines; or
other plants between the volutes, rivalling the acanthus foliage of the
classic capitals.</p>
<p>Sunset: a beautiful landscape all around; and a pretty view of the
travellers&rsquo; tents, the Arabs, and the cattle below me.</p>
<p>After dinner I walked by starlight along the Ionic colonnade, which is a
further continuation northwards of the Corinthian, and found nearly the
whole length, with the intermediate pavement, remaining, consisting of
squares about two feet in length, laid down in diamond pattern.</p>
<p>At night there were flickering lights and varieties of human voices
below; the frogs croaking loud near the rivulet; and the rooks, whom I had
dislodged from their home within the Roman bath, had taken refuge on the
trees about us, unable to get to rest, being disturbed by our unusual
sights and sounds.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;A visitor came early&mdash;namely,
Shaikh Yusuf&mdash;with two of his people from <i>Soof</i>.&nbsp; The old
man exhibited numerous certificates given by former travellers&mdash;all
English&mdash;whom he had accompanied as guide either to Beis&acirc;n or
Damascus.&nbsp; He offered his services to take us even, if we pleased, as
far as Bozrah.</p>
<p>Then came Shaikh Barak&acirc;t el Fraikh with a large train.&nbsp; He is
ruler over all the <i>Jebel &rsquo;Ajloon</i>, and has been residing lately
on the summit of a <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>high hill rising before us to the east, where
there is a weli or tomb of a Moslem saint, the Nebi Hhood, who works
miraculous cures.&nbsp; Barak&acirc;t is in delicate health, and has twenty
wives.&nbsp; His metropolis, when he condescends to live in a house, is at
a village called <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Enji</i>; but his district comprises
fifteen inhabited villages, with above three hundred in ruins,&mdash;so it
is said.</p>
<p>As for the saint himself, he has a very respectable name for antiquity,
too ancient for regular chronology to meddle with&mdash;it is only known
that he preached righteousness to an impious race of men previous to their
sudden destruction.&nbsp; The circumstance of his tomb being on the summit
of a high hill is perfectly consonant with the sentiments of great heroes
and chiefs, as frequently expressed in poems of the old Arabs.&nbsp; The
restoration of health which he is supposed to bestow, must be that effected
by means of the fine mountain air at his place.&nbsp; At
&rsquo;Amm&acirc;n, old &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez had said that
Jerash was built by the Beni &rsquo;Ad, a primitive race mentioned in the
Kor&acirc;n.</p>
<p>A ridiculous figure appeared of a Turkish subaltern officer, who has
come into this wild desert to ask the people for tribute to the
Porte.&nbsp; A Turkish kaww&acirc;s in attendance on him, I observed to
shrug up his shoulders when he heard nothing but Arabic being spoken among
us.&nbsp; They arrived here in the company of Shaikh Yusuf, whose son is
nominally a Turkish military officer, commanding <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>three hundred imaginary
Bashi-Bozuk, or irregular cavalry.&nbsp; By means of such titles they
tickle the vanity of the Arab leaders, and <i>claim</i> an annual tribute
of 218 purses, (about &pound;1000,) and are thus enabled to swell out the
published army list, and account of revenue printed in Constantinople. <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a></p>
<p>So that next to nothing is in reality derived from these few sparse
villages; and from the tent Arabs less than nothing, for the Turks have to
bribe these to abstain from plundering the regular soldiers belonging to
Damascus.</p>
<p>The &rsquo;Anezi Shaikh Faisel was encamped at only fourteen
hours&rsquo; distance from us.</p>
<p>Common Arab visitors arrived&mdash;from no one knew where: some on
horseback, to see what could be picked up among us; even women and
children.&nbsp; They must have travelled during the night.&nbsp; A
handsomely-dressed and well-armed youth on horseback, from Soof, accosted
me during one of my walks.</p>
<p>I bought two sheep for a feast to the Arabs that came about my tent; but
they asked to have the money value instead of the feast.&nbsp; Alas for the
degradation!&nbsp; What would their forefathers have said to them had they
been possibly present?</p>
<p>Afternoon: a fine breeze sprang up, as is usual in elevated
districts.&nbsp; I strolled again with an <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>attendant&mdash;first
outside the ancient wall on the east side of the rivulet, where it is not
much dilapidated; it is all built of rabbeted stones, though not of very
large size; then crossed over to the western wall, and traced out the whole
periphery of the city by the eye.</p>
<p>In the great Corinthian colonnade, one of our party called me to him,
and showed me some inscriptions about the public edifices along that line,
and at the Temple of the Sun.&nbsp; There was one inscription in Latin, on
a square pedestal; a similar one near it, broken across, had a Greek
inscription.&nbsp; The rest were all in Greek, but so defaced or injured
that seldom could a whole word be made out.&nbsp; However, we found, in a
small temple beyond the city wall to the north, in a ploughed field, an
inscription more perfect, containing the work <i>Nemesis</i> in the first
line.&nbsp; There also I saw several mausoleums, with sarcophagi handsomely
ornamented, and fragments of highly-polished red Egyptian granite columns,
to our great surprise as to how they had arrived there, considering not
only the distance from which they had been brought, and the variety of
people through whose hands they had passed since being cut out roughly from
the quarries of upper Egypt; but, moreover, the difficulty to be surmounted
in bringing them to this elevation, across the deep Jordan valley, even
since their disembarkation from the Mediterranean either at Jaffa or
Caiffa.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>The inscriptions that I had been able to collect were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p60.jpg">
<img alt="Two inscriptions" src="images/p60.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Among all the hundreds of fragments of fine capitals and friezes lying
about Jerash, there was not one that was not too heavy for us to carry
away.&nbsp; I found no ornamented pottery, although we had found some even
at Heshbon; neither coins, nor even bits of statues.&nbsp; And remarkable
enough in our European ideas, so little space appeared for private common
habitations&mdash;as usual among ruined cities of remote antiquity&mdash;it
seemed as if almost <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the whole enclosure was occupied by temples or
other public institutions.</p>
<p>Yet there must have habitations for a numerous population.&nbsp; And,
again, such a city implies the existence of minor towns and of numerous
villages around, and a complete immunity from incursions of wild Arab
tribes.&nbsp; These latter were unknown to a population who could build
such temples, naumachia, and colonnades, and who were protected farther
eastwards by the numerous cities with high roads, still discoverable in
ruins beyond this&mdash;Belka and &rsquo;Ajloon.&nbsp; But of how different
a character must have been the daily necessities of these old populations
from the requirements of modern European existence.&nbsp; <i>We</i> should
not be satisfied with the mere indulgence of gazing upon the &aelig;sthetic
beauty of temples and colonnades.&nbsp; Climate, however, has much to do in
this matter.</p>
<p>At night we had a general conference at the encampment respecting the
future march, as we had now finished with the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n Arabs. <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>The resolution was taken to proceed on the morrow to <i>Umm
Kais</i>, under the guidance of Shaikh Yusuf of Soof, and proceed thence to
Tiberias.&nbsp; He, however, would not ensure but that we might be met and
mulcted by the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r for leave to traverse their
territory.&nbsp; He was to receive 500 piastres, (nearly &pound;5,) besides
50 piastres for baksheesh; but whatever we might have to pay the Beni
Sukh&rsquo;r was to be deducted from the above stipulation.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Great noise of jackdaws under my
vaulted roof at break of day, they having mustered up courage to return to
their nests there during the night.</p>
<p>During the packing up of the luggage, I took a final and lonely walk
along the colonnades to the Naumachia, and outside the wall S.W. of the
Amm&acirc;n gate, where I observed some columns, or portions of such, of
twisted pattern; returned by the bridge.&nbsp; The thrush, the cuckoo, and
the partridge were heard at no great distance, near the stream.</p>
<p>We left upon the meadow a parliamentary debate of Arabs gathered around
the chief&rsquo;s spear, all the men ranting and screaming as only such
people <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>can, and they only at the beginning or end of a bargain.</p>
<p>Slowly we defiled in a long line over rising ground, higher and higher,
upon a good highway, bordered on each side by numerous sarcophagi; as along
the Roman Appian Way; passed the well of <i>Shaikh el Bakkar</i>, and a
sarcophagus with a long inscription in Greek, which I regretted not having
discovered yesterday, so as to allow of copying it.&nbsp; From an eminence
we took the last view of the pompous colonnades of Jerash.</p>
<p>Away through the green woods of broad-leaved oak, among which were to be
found fine and numerous pine-trees, the air fragrant with honeysuckle, and
the whole scene enlivened by sweet song of the birds, there were hills in
sight all covered with pine.</p>
<p>Around Soof we found none of the druidical-looking remains mentioned by
Irby and Mangles, but some romantic landscape and vineyards all over the
hills.</p>
<p>Ten minutes beyond Soof we had a Roman milestone lying at our
feet.&nbsp; Some of us set to work in clearing earth away from it,
searching for an inscription, but could not spare sufficient time to do it
properly.&nbsp; We found, however, the letters PIVS &middot; PONTI . .
.&mdash;indicating the period of the Antonines.</p>
<p>Next there met us a large party of gipsies&mdash;known, among other
tokens, by the women&rsquo;s black hair being combed, which that of the
Bedawi women <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>would not be.&nbsp; What a motley meeting we formed&mdash;of
Moslems, Greek-Church dragomans, Protestants, and Fire-worshippers, as the
gipsies are always believed in Asia to be.</p>
<p>Among the oaks of gigantic size and enormously large arbutus, the effect
of our party winding&mdash;appearing and disappearing, in varied costumes
and brilliant colours&mdash;was very pleasing.</p>
<p>After a time we reached some fine meadow land, on which were large
flocks of sheep belonging to the Beni Hhassan, whose tents we saw not far
distant.&nbsp; The black and the white sheep were kept separate from each
other.</p>
<p>And then appeared, in succession to the right and left, several of the
rude erections, resembling the Celtic cromlechs, or <i>cist-vaens</i>,
above alluded to, from Irby and Mangles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p64.jpg">
<img alt="Erection resembling cromlech" src="images/p64.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Our guides told us that they abound all over the hills.&nbsp; All that
we saw were constructed each of four huge slabs of brown flinty-looking
stone, forming a chamber&mdash;two for sides, one at the back, <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and a cover
over all, which measured eleven feet by six.&nbsp; Their date must be long
anterior to the Roman period.&nbsp; They are manifestly not Jewish, and
consequently are of pagan origin.&nbsp; Are they altars? or are they of a
sepulchral character, raised over the graves of valiant warriors, whose
very names and nationality are lost? or do they indeed partake of both
designs&mdash;one leading easily to the other among a superstitious people,
who had no light of revelation?</p>
<p>My persuasion is that they were altars, as they seldom reach above four
feet from the ground; and if so, they would serve to show, as well as the
uprights forming a square temple by the sea-side, between Tyre and Sidon,
that not in every place did the Israelites sufficiently regard the
injunction of Deut. xii. 3, to demolish the idolatrous places of worship.
<a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a></p>
<p>Our road gradually ascended for a considerable time, till we attained
the brow of an eminence, where our woody, close scenery suddenly expanded
into a glorious extent of landscape.&nbsp; Straight before our eyes,
apparently up in the sky, was old Hermon, capped with snow.&nbsp; About his
base was a hazy belt; below this was the Lake of Gennesaroth; and nearer
still was an extent of meadow and woodland.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>The commanding object, however, was the grand mountain,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;That lifts its awful form,<br />
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm.<br />
Though round its breast the rolling clouds be spread,<br />
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this place we rested for a time.</p>
<p>All the day afterwards we kept upon high grounds, to avoid meeting any
of the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r&mdash;thus greatly increasing the length of the
day&rsquo;s march, and having to scramble over rocky hills without visible
paths.&nbsp; All this had been brought upon us by over-cleverness in
bargaining with Shaikh Yusuf, our guide.&nbsp; We had stipulated that, in
case of meeting with Bedaween Arabs, whatever should be demanded as
<i>ghufur</i>, or toll for crossing their ground, should be deducted from
his 500 piastres.&nbsp; He had informed us that the toll would be but a
trifle; but after the burden of it had been once thrown upon him, he
avoided the best and direct road, and we had hours of needless fatigue in
consequence.</p>
<p>As a peasant himself, the Arabs allow him and his people to pass free,
as no doubt they exact enough from the village in other forms; but they
consider themselves entitled to levy tribute on European travellers.&nbsp;
The latter, however, are always disposed to grumble at it.</p>
<p>We plunged again into thick green woods,&mdash;the oaks of
Bashan,&mdash;with merry birds carolling all <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>around.&nbsp; Oh, how
cheering was the scene, after that devastated land across the river, where
there is so little of forest land left in proportion to this!&nbsp; A
friend once remarked to me, that were the two territories in the same
relative conditions at the time of Joshua taking possession of Canaan, it
would require double amount of faith in God&rsquo;s promises, as they
ascended from Jericho to Ai, to believe that they had not left the promised
land behind them.&nbsp; Now, this might be met by several satisfactory
replies; but the plainest answer for the moment is, that the countries were
not then in the same conditions relatively as they now are.</p>
<p>We passed a rock-hewn sepulchre on the side of a hill, in good
condition,&mdash;just such as may be frequently seen in Palestine
proper,&mdash;then found a large herd of camels browsing; and passing
through a verdant glen, which issued upon cultivated fields, we came to the
village of <i>Mezer</i>, and soon after to <i>Tuleh</i>, where we got a
view of Tabor, Gilboa, and Hermon, <a name="citation67"></a><a
href="#footnote67" class="citation">[67]</a> all at the same time.&nbsp;
Were the day clear, there could be no doubt but we should have seen also
the village of Zer&rsquo;een (Jezreel) and the convent on Mount Carmel.</p>
<p>The weather was hot, and our people suffering from thirst, as Ramadan
had that day commenced.</p>
<p>Had a distant view of a Beni Sukh&rsquo;r <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>encampment to our
right.&nbsp; After a steep descent, and consequent rise again, we were upon
a plain; and therefore the guide counselled us to keep close together, as a
precaution against marauders.&nbsp; Our tedious deviation to-day had been
far to the east: we now turned westwards, as if marching right up to Tabor,
over corn-fields, with the village of <i>Tibni</i> at our left, and
<i>Dair</i> at our right hand.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Tayibeh</i>, and encamped there for the night.&nbsp; Among
the first people who came up to us was an Algerine Jew, who held my horse
as I dismounted.&nbsp; He was an itinerant working silversmith, gaining a
livelihood by going from Tiberias among Arab villages and the Bedaween,
repairing women&rsquo;s ornaments, etc.</p>
<p>There are plenty of wells about this place, but none with good
water.&nbsp; Wrangling and high words among the muleteers, and fighting of
the animals for approach to the water-troughs.&nbsp; The day had been very
fatiguing; and our Moslem attendants, as they had been involuntarily
deprived of water during this the first day of Ramadan, deemed it not worth
while at that hour to break the fast, as evening was rapidly coming
on.&nbsp; Upon a journey, if it be a real journey on business, they are
allowed to break the fast, on condition of making up for the number of days
at some time before the year expires.</p>
<p>Evening: beautiful colours on the western hills, <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and the new moon
appearing&mdash;a thin silver streak in the roseate glow which remains in
the heavens after sunset.&nbsp; The night very hot, and no air moving.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i>, 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;After a night of mosquito-plague, we
rose at the first daybreak, with a glorious spectacle of Mount Hermon and
its snowy summit to the north.&nbsp; Such evenings and mornings as
travellers and residents enjoy in Asian climes are beyond all estimation,
and can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>We learned that there are Christians in this village of <i>Tayibeh</i>,
as indeed there are some thinly scattered throughout the villages of
<i>Jebel &rsquo;Ajloon</i>, <i>i.e.</i> from Jerash to near Tiberias; and
in the corresponding villages on the western side of Jordan, as far as
Nabloos.</p>
<p>I always feel deeply concerned for those &ldquo;sheep without a
shepherd,&rdquo; dispersed among an overwhelming population of
Mohammedans.&nbsp; They are indeed ignorant,&mdash;how can they be
otherwise, while deprived of Christian fellowship, or opportunities of
public worship, excepting when they carry their infants a long journey for
baptism, or when the men repair occasionally to the towns of Nabloos or
Nazareth for trading business; or, it may be, when rarely an itinerant
priest pays them a visit?&mdash;still they are living representatives of
the Gentile Church of the country in primitive days, down through
continuous ages,&mdash;their families enduring martyrdom, and to this day
persecution and oppression, <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>for the name of Christ, in spite of every
worldly inducement to renounce it.&nbsp; While we Europeans are reciting
the Nicene Creed in our churches, they are suffering for it.&nbsp; They are
living witnesses for the &ldquo;Light of light, and very God of very
God;&rdquo; and although with this they mingle sundry superstitions, they
are a people who salute each other at Easter with the words, &ldquo;Christ
is risen,&rdquo; and the invariable response, &ldquo;He is risen
indeed;&rdquo; also in daily practice, when pronouncing the name of Jesus,
they add the words, &ldquo;Glory to His name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides all the above, they are in many things Protestants against Papal
corruption.&nbsp; They have no Vicar of Christ, no transubstantiation, no
immaculate conception, no involuntary confession, and no hindrance to a
free use of the Bible among the laity.&nbsp; For my part, I feel happy in
sympathising much with such a people, and cannot but believe that the
Divine Head of the Church regards with some proportion of love even the
humblest believer in Him, who touches but the hem of His garment.</p>
<p>In our conversation, before resuming the journey, I mentioned the
numerous villages that were to be found about that neighbourhood, utterly
broken up, but where the gardens of fig, vine, and olive trees still are
growing around the ruins.&nbsp; The people pointed out to me the direction
of other such, that were out of sight from our tents; and the Jew quoted a
familiar proverb of the country <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>relating to that subject; also the Moslem
shaikh, with his son, joined also in reciting it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The children of Israel built up;<br />
The Christians kept up;<br />
The Moslems have destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In saying this, however, by the second line they refer to the crusading
period; and by the last line they denote the bad government of the Turks,
under which the wild Bedaween are encroaching upon civilisation, and
devastating the recompense of honest industry from the fertile soil.</p>
<p>We&mdash;starting upon our last day&rsquo;s journey
together&mdash;passed over wide fields of wheat-stubble.&nbsp; On coming
near the village of <i>Samma</i>, the old shaikh came out to welcome us,
and inquire if his place is written in the books of the Europeans.&nbsp; On
examining our maps, one of our party found it in his; and the rest promised
the friendly old man that his village should be written down.</p>
<p>Proceeding through a green and rocky glen, between high hills, with a
running stream, the weather was exceedingly hot.&nbsp; Here our party
divided,&mdash;ourselves advancing towards <i>Umm Kais</i>; while the
baggage and servants turned to the left, so as to cross the Jordan by the
bridge <i>El Mej&acirc;ma&rsquo;a</i> for Tiberias.&nbsp; The principal
intention of this was for the property to avoid the chance of falling into
the hands of the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r.&nbsp; Shaikh Yusuf now showed the
relief from his mind by beginning to <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>sing.&nbsp; This was
all very well for him, who had nothing to lose; because, as it was said
long ago&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After wandering round and around, we descended into <i>Wadi Zahari</i>,
&ldquo;the flowering valley,&rdquo; where, by the water-side, were reeds
and oleanders forty or fifty feet high; and near them we observed a
pear-tree and a fig-tree, all alone and deserted, the remains of former
cultivation.&nbsp; This and other previous instances attest the risk that
attends rural labour in that district, being in the immediate vicinity of
the Bedaween, and the utter mockery of nominal Turkish rule.&nbsp; Here we
filled our leathern water-bottles, (called <i>zumzum&icirc;a</i> in the
Desert, and <i>m&aacute;ttara</i> by towns-people,) and climbed up a stony
hill, the heat of the day increasing.&nbsp; No path among the rocks, and
all of us angry at Shaikh Yusuf for saving himself the few piastres by
conducting us among such difficulties.</p>
<p>Then, after some time we perceived ourselves to be near Umm Kais, by the
sarcophagi, the sepulchres, and ruts of chariot-wheels upon the
rocks.&nbsp; We rushed up to a large tree for refreshing shelter, and near
it found numerous sepulchres, highly ornamented, and some of them with the
stone doors remaining on the hinges, which we swung about to test the
reality of their remaining so perfect, (figs. 1, 2, 3.)</p>
<p>Among these was the one remarked by Lord <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Lindsay in his Travels,
bearing a Hebrew name inscribed in Greek letters, but which he has not</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p73a.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 1" src="images/p73a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>given quite correctly.&nbsp; It should be <i>Gaanuiph</i> instead of
<i>Gaaniph</i>.&nbsp; This sepulchre is cut in black</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p73b.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 2" src="images/p73b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>basaltic rock, and has some broken sarcophagi remaining inside.&nbsp; On
a round fragment of a column, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>near this side, is the inscription given below,
(fig. 4.)&nbsp; The upper part is the farewell of surviving relatives</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p74a.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 3" src="images/p74a.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>to the daughter of SEMLACHUS. The lower part, for whomsoever
intended,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>and thou also farewell</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;carries
with it a touch of nature that still affects the heart, after the lapse of
many centuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p74b.jpg">
<img alt="Fig. 4" src="images/p74b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The mausoleums and sepulchres at the opposite end of the city were even
more numerous, many having Greek inscriptions upon them.</p>
<p>But the theatre is the most remarkable of all the objects of
antiquity,&mdash;so <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>perfect, with its rows of seats complete,
surrounded by numerous public edifices and lines of columns; and then
commanding from those seats a large view of the beautiful Lake of Tiberias,
and of the grand mountains which enclose it, as a frame to the picture.</p>
<p>Here I stayed behind the rest of the party for a considerable time,
charmed with the spectacle of nature, and revolving over the incidents of
Herodian history, so vividly portrayed by Josephus.</p>
<p>Then rejoined my friends, by galloping along a Roman road, paved with
blocks of dark basalt.</p>
<p>But before leaving this place, I must express my surprise at any person
that has been there imagining for a moment that it can be the Gadara of
Scripture.</p>
<p>The distance from the lake is so great as to be utterly incompatible
with the recorded transactions in the Gospels&mdash;having valleys and high
hills intervening; and even supposing the miracle of relieving the demoniac
to refer not to the city but to a territory named Gadara, it is
inconceivable that the territory belonging to this city (Umm Kais) could
extend beyond the deep natural crevasse of the river <i>Yarmuk</i>, and
then rise up a high mountain, to descend again into a plain, all before
reaching the lake.</p>
<p>Our descent to the Yarmuk was long and steep; and upon the plain which
it intersects, the heat exceeded any that I had ever encountered
anywhere.&nbsp; <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The air was like fire.&nbsp; Such a day I shall
never forget.</p>
<p>The Yarmuk is so considerable a river that the Arabs call it
<i>Sheree&rsquo;a</i>, as they do the Jordan&mdash;only qualifying the
latter as the larger one.&nbsp; It is called the <i>Sheree&rsquo;a el
Men&acirc;dh&#277;rah</i>, from a party of Bedaween occupying its banks in
the interior.</p>
<p>The crevasse through which it issues is wild and romantic in the
extreme.&nbsp; High cliffs of basalt are the confines of the water.&nbsp;
This, on reaching the plain, is parted with several streams, (to compare
great things with small,) in the fashion of the Nile or the Ganges; which
the Jordan is not, either at its entrance into this lake or its entrance
into the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>All the streams are fringed with oleander; and, in the extreme heat of
the day, the horses enjoyed not only their drinking, but their wading
through the rolling water.</p>
<p>This was the boundary between Bashan and Gilead, through the latter of
which we had hitherto been travelling, and gave name to the great battle
A.D. 637, where the victory obtained by the fierce <i>Khalid</i> and the
mild <i>Abu Obeidah</i> decided the fate of Palestine, and opened the way
of the Moslems to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Over an extent of four or five miles, before reaching the Jordan, a rich
harvest of wheat was being reaped upon the plain.&nbsp; We first attempted
to cross at <i>Samakh</i>, but finding it impossible at that season, <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>had to
turn back to the ford at the broken bridge, which the natives call the
&lsquo;mother of arches,&rsquo; (<i>Umm el Kan&acirc;ter</i>;) and even
there the water was still deep.</p>
<p>Corn-fields and flocks of sheep in every direction; but all the
shepherds carrying firearms.&nbsp; We most of us lay down on our breasts to
drink greedily once more from the dear old river; and then we crossed the
Jordan into the land of Canaan, going on to Tiberias, and passing on the
way some Franciscan monks.&nbsp; What a change of associations from those
of the country we had traversed exclusively for the last nine days!</p>
<p>How absurd the sudden and unexpected contrast from old
&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez and the brilliant young &rsquo;Ali
D&euml;&acirc;b in the freedom of the desert, to the cowl and the convent
of the monks&mdash;from the grand savage language of the Ishmaelite to the
mellifluous Italian.</p>
<p>At the hot baths of the lake we found our tents already pitched, and my
old friend the missionary,&mdash;Thomson, from Bayroot,&mdash;who had been
travelling on the eastern side of the lake, (a territory so little known,)
and, as he and I believed, had discovered the true Gadara.&nbsp; We
compared notes about affairs of the Arabs at the time.</p>
<p>Several of the juvenile travellers set themselves to swimming before
dinner at sunset, the huge hills at the back casting long shadows across
the lake.</p>
<p>We all had tea together, as we were to separate to our several
destinations in the morning; and on <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>my retiring to sleep,
the thermometer was at 99&deg; Fahrenheit inside the open tent.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bathing before the sun rose.</p>
<p>Our travellers engaged the boat from Tiberias for the day, and it came
up from the town to our camp with the sail spread.&nbsp; Large flights of
aquatic birds as usual flitting and diving about the lake, and the fish
abundant, rising and splashing at the surface.</p>
<p>For an hour or two before starting on my way southwards, I lay on the
beach contemplating the lovely scenery, and collecting my thoughts, both as
to the past and for the future.&nbsp; The principal object of meditation
was of course the placid lake itself&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear with the thoughts of Him we love so well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the noble old mountain of Hermon, crowned with snow, now called
<i>Jebel esh Shaikh</i>; which the Sidonians called Sirion; and the
Amorites called Shenir, (Deut. iii. 9.)</p>
<p>Next the ever-celebrated Jordan, with its typical resemblance to the
limit dividing this life from the purchased possession of
heaven,&mdash;recalling so much of bright images of Christian poetry
employed to cheer the weary pilgrim, in anticipation of the time when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll range the sweet fields on the banks of the river,<br
/>
And sing of salvation for ever and ever!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gratefully acknowledging the providence which had brought us happily so
far, the present writer then girded up his mental loins, and returned to
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Jerusalem; but on the way occasionally glancing towards the
eastward range of mountains,&mdash;the land of Gilead,&mdash;now called
Belka and &rsquo;Ajloon, lately traversed; and with a feeling unknown since
the verses were first echoed in childhood, the words involuntarily issue
from the lips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sihon, king of the Amorites,<br />
&nbsp;  For His mercy endureth for ever,<br />
And Og the king of Bashan,<br />
&nbsp;  For His mercy endureth for ever!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having learned that &rsquo;Akeeli Aga el Hh&acirc;si was encamped on the
Jordan side, at no great distance, I resolved to visit this personage, who
has since then become much more famous as a French prot&eacute;g&eacute;,
being an Arab of Algeria, but at this time only noted as having been the
guide of the United States Expedition to the Dead Sea in 1848, and as being
at the moment commissioned by the Turks as a Kaimakam of the district,
seeing that they could not hold even nominal rule there without him.</p>
<p>At my starting there came up from his post a messenger, Hhasan Aga, the
Bosniac officer of Bashi Bozuk, to conduct me to the tents.&nbsp; The Aga
was dressed in a crimson silk long coat, over which was a scarlet jacket
embroidered in gold, and on his legs the Albanian full kilt, or fustinella,
of white calico; his saddle cloth was of pea-green silk with a white
border, and yellow worsted network protected the horse&rsquo;s belly from
flies, also a rich cloth with tassels lay over the horse&rsquo;s loins.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>Proceeded southwards, and passed the broken bridge before
mentioned.&nbsp; Harvest everywhere in progress, and the produce being
carried home on asses to the village of <i>&rsquo;Abad&icirc;yeh</i>,
adjoining to the houses of which were square and flat tents made of
palm-leaf matting as residences of the Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs.</p>
<p>Came to the ruins of a wretched little village called
<i>Belhham&icirc;yeh</i>, formerly under the patronage of the
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n; and thence appeared in full view upon the hill above
the great castle of the Crusaders called Belvoir, but now named
<i>Cocab</i>, or <i>Cocab el Hawa</i>.&nbsp; Upon the plain by the river
side was the encampment scattered about, and several European tents among
the others denoted the presence of Turkish soldiers.</p>
<p>We could see the Jis&rsquo;r el Mej&acirc;ma&rsquo;a, the bridge leading
across to the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>Rode up to &rsquo;Akeeli&rsquo;s tent, and found with him the formidable
Shaikh Fendi el Faiz of the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r, and a musician with his
reb&acirc;beh.&nbsp; A slave was making coffee on a fire of dried
camel&rsquo;s dung, although it was in the fast of Ramad&acirc;n.&nbsp; We
conversed guardedly about D&euml;&acirc;b and the rest of the
&rsquo;Adw&acirc;n, and the camp at <i>Dahair el Hhum&acirc;r</i>.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Akeeli then had brought in for his amusement a wild beast called a
<i>fahh&rsquo;d</i>, differing from a panther in being larger and in having
black stripes down the face; it seemed wild enough, but was confined by a
rope, the pulling of which, and alternately <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>patting the creature
was the amusement or occupation of the Aga.&nbsp; They brought me some
coffee and water to drink, whereupon &rsquo;Akeeli called for some too, and
said to me&mdash;&ldquo;These fools of Mohammedans are keeping
Ramad&acirc;n, but I am a Frenchman,&rdquo; he then drank off the
water.&nbsp; This man, whom Lynch, the American commander, styles a
&ldquo;magnificent savage,&rdquo; was savage enough in manners, and dirty,
and half-naked.&nbsp; He has since, however, made his influence felt, and
may perhaps do so again.</p>
<p>Altogether, my reception was not one in accordance with my notions of
Arab hospitality.&nbsp; Perhaps he did not wish me to espy what was going
on about him in company with Shaikh Fendi el Faiz, so I took my leave,
riding towards Cocab.&nbsp; At an Arab encampment we got some <i>Leben
Sheneeni</i>, (soured fresh milk, most delicious in hot weather,) and drank
almost a pailful of it between myself, the kaww&acirc;s, and the
muleteer.&nbsp; The heat was prodigious.&nbsp; In the camp were only women
and children at home: the former employed in weaving and dyeing woollen
trappings for horses,&mdash;serving to keep off the plague of
flies,&mdash;of which articles we bought two.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Akeeli had sent an escort to accompany us as far us the
castle.&nbsp; One of the men was a care-worn old fellow from the far north,
wearing a very heavy sheepskin coat with wide sleeves, to keep out the
scorching heat of the sun, and his face covered <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>with a <i>mandeel</i>
or cotton handkerchief, to protect him from reflection from the ground; his
venerable musket terminated in a rusty bayonet.</p>
<p>We went southwards until opposite the bridge, then turned westward to
the hills, and forded the water of <i>Wadi Berreh</i>.&nbsp; The ascent was
difficult and long, during which our escort carried on a conversation in
the Arnaout language.</p>
<p>At the summit I sent on the servants and baggage to Jeneen, there to
pitch the tents for us&mdash;the sheepskin man, the kaww&acirc;s, and I
turned aside to survey the old castle at Cocab el Hawa.&nbsp; It has been a
large and noble erection in a strong natural position; the trench and
sloping walls are pretty perfect, the stone-work being still sharp-edged;
the portion of the defences looking towards the Jordan consists of large
stones rabbeted, equal to any work in Jerusalem or elsewhere, which must be
an indication of a fortress long before the time of the
Crusaders&mdash;though the stones are not of dimensions equal to those of
the Jerusalem Temple wall.</p>
<p>All the masonry, except the rabbeted work, is constructed from the dark
basalt which abounds in that district.&nbsp; All the space within walls,
not remaining entire, and part of the trench, is occupied by miserable
hovels, forming a sort of village, with patches of tobacco cultivation
attached to the dwellings.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>But what can one say in description of the glorious prospect from
that eminence?&nbsp; It seemed to me to exceed the wonders of Nebi Osha:
the principal objects in view being the Lake of Tiberias, the river Jordan,
Tabor, Duhy, Beis&acirc;n, Carmel, Hermon, a stretch of the Hauran, and the
cleft of the Yarmuk.&nbsp; One thing surprised me, which was to see how far
South Cocab is from Tabor, it had never appeared so before from the
direction of Jeneen or of Nazareth.&nbsp; It was due east from <i>Duhy</i>;
the best way of getting at it from Nabloos is across the plain of
Jezreel.&nbsp; It is distinguishable from a great distance by means of a
white-washed tower standing in the midst of the castle.</p>
<p>Forwards we went through a village called <i>Kifereh</i>.&nbsp; As usual
the ride over the plain is very tedious and tiring to the limbs&mdash;a
hilly country in moderation is much more comfortable.&nbsp; We reached
<i>Shutta</i>, then the tents of the Shi&ucirc;kh Arabs close under hills,
and beneath a hill called <i>Nooris</i>, and at a mill called
<i>Jalood</i>, we were overtaken by rain late in the year, being the 19th
of May.</p>
<p>The sun set a good while before our arriving at Zer&rsquo;een (Jezreel);
the road was not straight, for a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> was necessary in
order to ensure firm ground among the marshes; stagnated water abounds,
that has been poured down from the hills of Gilboa.&nbsp; We passed the
natural cavern from which the Jalood water issues on the side of a
hill.&nbsp; <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>A large cistern is formed at the place.&nbsp; The
inhabitants&mdash;such as we saw occasionally&mdash;were very unhealthy in
appearance.</p>
<p>Night came on, and dew with it, to which we had been long
unaccustomed.&nbsp; The storm cleared off, and we travelled several hours
by moonlight.&nbsp; Then we saw abundance of fire-flies flitting across our
way.</p>
<p>Overtaking our luggage, we all jogged on slowly together, very tired and
silent, till a horseman appeared, who galloped off on our inquiry,
&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length we heard the welcome sounds of frogs croaking, then dogs
barking, then saw the lights of Jeneen, and being Ramad&acirc;n the minaret
there was illuminated with festoons of lamps.</p>
<p>Then we reached the appointed well-known grove of olive trees.</p>
<p>Our day had been very long and fatiguing&mdash;the cattle
exhausted.&nbsp; It was Saturday night, and the week ended with the
intelligence that Shaikh Barak&acirc;t el Fraikh had declared war against
the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r, so that we had just passed through the Over-Jordan
country in time to be able to do so.&nbsp; At Jerash I had met
Barak&acirc;t, and at &rsquo;Akeeli&rsquo;s camp had met his adversary
Fendi el Faiz.</p>

85</span>II.&nbsp; NORTHWARDS TO BEIS&Acirc;N, KADIS, ANTIPATRIS, etc.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">October 23, 1850.</p>
<p>Leaving Jerusalem upon the Nabloos road, and crossing the upper portion
of the valley which, lower down, after a curve becomes the valley of
Jehoshaphat, we passed almost directly over the sepulchre of Simon the
Just, of whom such &ldquo;excellent things are spoken&rdquo; in the books
of the Maccabees, and in whose memory an annual festival is kept by the
Jerusalem Jews on this spot on the day called
&#1512;&#1501;&#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1503;&quot;&#1500; rather more than a
month after the passover.&nbsp; Two other saints are celebrated on the same
day of the calendar&mdash;viz., R. Simeon bar Jochai, the cabbalist of
Safed, author of <i>Zohar</i>, and R. Akiva of Tiberias.</p>
<p>Then mounting up the side of Scopus, we halted for a few minutes to
survey that view of the holy city which surpasses all others, and must have
done so in the palmy days of history.&nbsp; It was at the time of
mid-afternoon, when the sun&rsquo;s rays pour slantingly with grand effect
upon the Temple site.&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>I could not but recollect that this was exactly
the hour appointed for the daily evening sacrifice &ldquo;between the two
evenings,&rdquo; (Hebrew of Exod. xii. 6,) and think of the choral music of
Levitical services grandly reverberating among the semicircle of hills.</p>
<p>Meditations of this nature would lead one far away in varied directions,
perhaps unsuited for the commencement of a long journey lying before
us.</p>
<p>The next object attracting our attention was the Roman milestone lying
beside the road, shortly</p>

<p>after passing <i>Sha&rsquo;af&acirc;t</i>.&nbsp; This I always make it a
rule to examine every time of passing it.&nbsp; At one time I had it rolled
over in order to be able to read the inscription; but I afterwards found it
tossed with the writing downwards&mdash;perhaps all the better for its
preservation.</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p87.jpg">
<img alt="Milestone inscription" src="images/p87.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>That is to say, a register of the names of the Antonine emperors; but
there must have been other names on the upper part, now broken away.</p>
<p>Then passed under <i>Er Ram</i> on our right hand, the Ramah of the Old
Testament, but as it is not often noticed, may be found in Jeremiah xl. 1,
as the place where the Babylonish captain of the guard, as a favour,
released the prophet, after bringing him with the rest in chains from
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Slept in a house at <i>Ram Allah</i>.&nbsp; This is a village about
three-quarters of an hour N.W. from Er Ram.&nbsp; The weather being cold we
first lit a fire, thereby trying the utility of a chimney that was in the
house&mdash;in vain, for no smoke would pass up it; it all settled in the
room itself; and the people excused themselves on the ground that it had
never been tried before.&nbsp; Probably it was a novelty imported to the
place by some of the people who had been employed by Europeans in
Jerusalem; and yet I have always found that the old Saracenic <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>houses of the
Effendis in Jerusalem have all of them chimneys; and the word for
<i>chimney</i> is well known in Arabic.</p>
<p>This being almost exclusively a Christian village, it was interesting to
hear the people addressing each other as Peter, James, Elijah, John, Paul,
etc., instead of Mohammed, Ali, Omar, or other such appellations.&nbsp; It
is a little beside the purpose, but I may remark in passing, that
throughout these countries there are names in use common to all
religions,&mdash;some scriptural, as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, or
David; and others mere epithets, as Assaad or Selim.</p>
<p>In this village are three priests, (Greek orthodox,) idle, ignorant, and
coarse men; but the peasantry are a bold set of fellows, speaking and
acting very independently of clerical domination,&mdash;very indifferent as
to whether they shall turn Protestants or Papists.&nbsp; One thing they are
in earnest about, and that is to get schools for their children.</p>
<p>Ram Allah exhibits the same characteristic as all other Christian
villages in Palestine, that of being in good condition&mdash;new houses
being built, and old ones repaired; contrary to the condition of Moslem
villages, almost without one exception&mdash;that of falling to
decay.&nbsp; There is, however, no water here; the women bring it in jars
upon their heads from <i>Beeri</i>, a considerable distance.</p>
<p>We made a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> from the high-road, in order to look for
<i>Jifna</i>, the <i>Gophna</i> of Josephus, where Titus <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and his renowned Tenth
Legion (recently arrived from Britain) slept the night before reaching
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Then the Eagles were gathered together over the doomed
carcass of the city.&nbsp; Inquiring our way from Ram Allah to Jifna, some
said there was a road without going to Beeri; some said there was
none.&nbsp; At length we were put upon a pretty decent path.</p>
<p>In ten minutes we came to a sort of well with a little water, where
women were thumping clothes upon stones; this is called washing in the
East.&nbsp; Magnificent view westwards of the great plain, the Great Sea,
Jaffa, Ramlah, etc.</p>
<p>We wandered about hills and among vineyards, and came to a small village
named <i>Doorah</i>, in good condition, with water, and excellent
cultivation of garden vegetables in small patches, similar to those of
Selwan (Siloam) and Urt&acirc;s; then turning a corner saw Jifna at some
distance, in the midst of a plain enclosed by hills; and there it must have
been that the manipulus with S.P.Q.R. was posted in front of Italian tents,
and the soldiers bustling about or jesting in Latin or British language,
before their retiring to rest, in the spring season of the year A.D.
70.</p>
<p>Becoming entangled among a long belt of vineyards between us and it, and
time passing away while our luggage was far on the road to Nabloos, we
turned aside and regained the high-road at <i>&rsquo;Ain Yebrood</i>.&nbsp;
Reluctantly I retreated from <i>Jifna</i>, <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>for I had wished to
discover the precise road upon which Titus and his army marched towards
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Passing <i>Sinjil</i>, <i>Lubb&acirc;n</i>, and
<i>S&acirc;w&icirc;yeh</i>, we rested just beyond
<i>S&acirc;w&icirc;yeh</i> under the great oak, at the divergence of the
valley of <i>Laithma</i>.&nbsp; Beneath its wide-spreading branches a flock
of sheep was resting at noon (Cant. i. 7.)&nbsp; From these we got good
draughts of fresh milk.</p>
<p>As evening approached, we were passing within the huge shadow of Mount
Gerizim; and in Nabloos I remained till Monday morning,&mdash;this being
the end of Thursday.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&nbsp; Preparing for descent into the Jordan valley, I
engaged, in addition to the usual servants, a horseman of the Bashi Bozuk,
recommended by the local governor, Suliman Bek Tok&acirc;n.&nbsp; It seemed
prudent to obtain this man&rsquo;s attendance, as he might be known and
recognised by disorderly persons throughout the turbulent and unknown
country before me, whatever might be his character for valour or
discretion.&nbsp; Two of the native Protestants of Nabloos accompanied me
also for about four hours on the way.</p>
<p>Passing Joseph&rsquo;s sepulchre and the village of <i>Asker</i>, (is
not this Sychar? it is near the traditional Jacob&rsquo;s Well,) we went
northwards over the plain of <i>Mukhneh</i>, equivalent to Makhaneh,
&ldquo;camp,&rdquo; in Hebrew, (the <i>Moreh</i> of Gen. xii. 6, Deut. xi.
30, and Judges vii. 1) having left the eastern valley with <i>Salem</i>
(Gen. xxxiii. 18) on our right.&nbsp; <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>To my surprise the
plain was soon and abruptly terminated at the foot of a very lofty
mountain, and we commenced a descent among chasms of great convulsions of
nature, displaying remarkable contortions of geological strata.&nbsp; This
brought us into the Wadi <i>En-Nab</i>, so called from the growth there of
a fruit-tree, (the Jujube,) bearing that name, better in quality than
anywhere else in Palestine; and, indeed, the tree is found in but few other
places.&nbsp; At the confluence of this valley with the Wadi
<i>Bed&acirc;n</i> there are several fragments of ancient columns
remaining, quite four feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Hitherto we had met many more peasants travelling with merchandise than
I had expected.&nbsp; They were all going in one direction, namely, towards
Nabloos, and therefore from Es-Salt in Gilead, beyond Jordan.</p>
<p>These, however, ceased after we had crossed the water of Wadi
Bed&acirc;n into the larger <i>Wadi Fara&rsquo;ah</i>,&mdash;which is,
however, the high-road to Es-Salt.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards we observed, by our wayside, a square of solid ancient
masonry, three courses high.&nbsp; In England this would be certainly the
pedestal of some old demolished market-cross; but it may have been the
lower part of some memorial pyramid.&nbsp; In the previous year I had seen
just such another at Ziph (Josh. xv. 55,) beyond Hebron.</p>
<p>Then we came upon a distinct piece of Roman paved road, which showed
that we were upon the <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>high-road between Neapolis and Scythopolis,
<i>alias</i> Shechem and Bethshan, <i>alias</i> Nabloos and
Beis&acirc;n.&mdash;Crossed a stream richly bordered with rosy-blossomed
oleander, and soon turned the head of the water.&nbsp; A demolished castle
was on our right, commanding the entrance of Wadi Fara&rsquo;ah.</p>
<p>Soon after noon we gained the olive-trees alongside of
<i>Tub&acirc;s</i>, a prosperous village, yet inhabited by a people as rude
and coarse as their neighbours.&nbsp; Tub&acirc;s is always liable to
incursions from the eastern Bedaween, and always subject to the local wars
of the Tokan and &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Hadi factions.&nbsp; I have known it
to be repeatedly plundered.&nbsp; The natural soil here is so fertile that
its wheat and its oil, together with those of <i>Hanoon</i>, fetch the
highest prices in towns; and the grain is particularly sought after as seed
for other districts.</p>
<p>The place, however, is most remarkable to us as being the <i>Thebez</i>
of Judges ix. 50, where Abimelech was slain by the women hurling a
millstone on his head from the wall.&nbsp; The more I become acquainted
with the peculiar population of <i>Jebel Nabloos</i>, (<i>i.e.</i> the
territory of which Nabloos is the metropolis,) a brutish people
&ldquo;waxing fat and kicking,&rdquo; the more does the history of the book
of Judges, especially the first twelve chapters, read like a record of
modern occurrences thereabouts.&nbsp; It is as truly an Arab history as any
other oriental book can supply.&nbsp; I observed that Mount Gerizim can be
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>seen
from Tub&acirc;s,&mdash;which fact seemed to give additional emphasis to
the words, &ldquo;And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render
upon their heads; and upon those came the curse of Jotham, the son of
Jerubbaal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site of Tub&acirc;s is elevated.&nbsp; It is still a considerable
village, and possesses that decided evidence of all very ancient sites in
Palestine&mdash;a large accumulation of rubbish and ashes.</p>
<p>I was told that here, as well as in several of the villages around,
there are scattered Christians, one or two families in each among the
Moslems, without churches, without clergy, without books or education of
any kind; still they are Christians, and carry their infants to the Greek
Church in Nabloos for baptism.&nbsp; What a deplorable state of
things!&nbsp; Since the date of this journey the Church Missionary
Society&rsquo;s agents have in some degree ministered to the spiritual
destitution of these poor people by supplying some at least with copies of
the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Here my principal kaww&acirc;s, Hadj Mohammed es Serw&acirc;n, found the
fever, which had been upon him more or less for the last three days, so
greatly increased, that it was not possible for him to proceed farther with
me.&nbsp; The fever he attributed to his having, on arrival at Nabloos,
indulged too freely in figs and milk together.&nbsp; The general experience
of the country warrants this conclusion.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! after several times dismounting, <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and renewing his
efforts to keep up with me, he was at length totally disabled; and our
Protestant friends, who were now about to return home, engaged to get him
into the village, and have him carefully attended to, there and at Nabloos,
till he should be able to return to his family at Jerusalem.&nbsp; I left
him under a large tree, gazing wistfully after me, and endeavouring to
persuade me not to go down to that Gehennom of a place, Beis&acirc;n. <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a></p>
<p>My forward journey lay through fine olive-grounds and stubble-fields of
wheat.&nbsp; In an hour we passed <i>Kayaseer</i>, a wretched but ancient
place, with exceedingly old olive-trees about it.&nbsp; Then going on for
some time among green bushes and straggling shoots of trees, we descended
to the water-bed of a valley.&nbsp; Once more upon a Roman road, on which
at twenty minutes&rsquo; distance was a prostrate Roman milestone, but with
no inscription to be seen; perhaps it was on the under side, upon the
ground.&nbsp; Then the road, paved as it was with Roman work, rose before
us on a steep slope, to a plain which was succeeded by the
&ldquo;Robbers&rsquo; Valley,&rdquo; (Wadi el Hharam&icirc;yeh,) in which
we met two peasants driving an ass, and inquired of them &ldquo;Is the
plain of the Jordan safe?&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, Are there any wild Bedaween
about?&nbsp; The reply was &ldquo;It <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>is safe;&rdquo; but the
whole conversation consisted of four words in the question, and one in the
answer.</p>
<p>Over a precipitous and broken rocky hill,&mdash;the worst piece of road
I ever met with,&mdash;till we came suddenly upon the grand savage scenery
of the Gh&ocirc;r, with the eastern barrier of the mountains of
Gilead.&nbsp; The river Jordan is not visible, as is the case in most
parts, till one almost reaches the banks.</p>
<p>Here the vegetation had changed its character,&mdash;leaving all
civilisation of olive-trees behind, and almost all consisting of oak and
hawthorn.&nbsp; We had instead the <i>neb&rsquo;k</i> or
<i>d&ocirc;m-tree</i>, and the <i>ret&rsquo;m</i> or juniper of Scripture;
the heat excessive.</p>
<p>At the junction of the Valley with the Gh&ocirc;r are three Roman
milestones, lying parallel and close side by side,&mdash;all of them in the
shape and size stereotyped throughout the country.&nbsp; This, then, was
probably a measured station of unusual importance; and from it the
acropolis of Bethshan just comes into view.&nbsp; This is known in the
country by the name of <i>El Hhus&rsquo;n</i>.</p>
<p>The ground was in every direction covered with black basalt fragments,
among which, however, was corn stubble remaining; and we were told that the
crop belonged to the people of Tub&acirc;s.</p>
<p>We kept upon a straight path leading directly up to Beis&acirc;n, which
all the way was intersected by running streams issuing from the hills on
our left, and going to the Jordan.</p>
<p>The water was not often good for drinking; but <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>at most of these
rivulets our attendant, Suliman Bek&rsquo;s horseman, alighted to say his
prayers, out of fright on account of the Arab Bedaween.</p>
<p>Tabor N.W. and Hermon N.E. were both prominent objects in the landscape,
with the town of Beis&acirc;n between the two,&mdash;the ground abounding
in the kali plant and neb&rsquo;k trees, with bright yellow fruit, from
which we frequently saw clearly desert camels cropping the lower branches,
notwithstanding the long and sharp thorns upon them.</p>
<p>We marched straight on, from one ancient artificial mound to another,
with Beis&acirc;n before us, the streams all the way increasing in width
and rapidity,&mdash;some of them bordered, or even half-choked, with a
jungle of oleander in flower, hemlock, gigantic canes, wild fig-trees,
neb&rsquo;k, and tangled masses of blackberry.&nbsp; Some of them we had to
ford, or even leap our horses over.&nbsp; We were surprised at such
torrents of water rushing into the Jordan at such a season of the year.</p>
<p>Reached Beis&acirc;n at half-past six,&mdash;a wild-looking place, with
magnificent mountains in every direction around, but all frowning black
with volcanic basalt; and the people horribly ugly&mdash;black and
ferocious in physiognomy.&nbsp; They were just in the busiest time of the
indigo harvest; but they had herds of very fine cows brought home, as the
sun in setting threw over us the shadow of the mountains of Gilboa.&nbsp;
My companion from Jerusalem looked up with horror to these hills, and began
quoting <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>the poetic malediction of David upon them on account of the death
of Saul and Jonathan: &ldquo;Let there be no dew, neither rain upon you,
nor fields of offerings,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>It was indeed a notable event in one&rsquo;s life to have arrived at the
place where the body of the first king of Israel, with that of his son, the
dear friend of David, after being beheaded, were nailed to the walls of the
city.&nbsp; Jabesh-Gilead could not have been very far off across the
Jordan; for its &ldquo;valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the walls of Bethshan, and
came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.&nbsp; And they took their bones and
buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days,&rdquo; (1 Sam.
xxxi. 12, 13).&nbsp; This respectful treatment was by way of grateful
recompense for Saul&rsquo;s past kindness, as the very first act of his
royalty had been to deliver them from danger when besieged by Nahash the
Ammonite (I Sam. xi.); and they kept his remains till king David removed
them into the ancestral sepulchre within the tribe of Benjamin (2 Sam. xxi.
14).</p>
<p>To return.&nbsp; The people of Beis&acirc;n urged upon us their advice
not to sleep in our tents, for fear of Arabs, who were known to be about
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I however preferred to remain as I was; and many
of the people slept around the tents upon heaps of indigo plant, making
fires for themselves from the straw.&nbsp; Before retiring to sleep, I
several times found the horseman at his prayers by <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>moonlight.&nbsp; During
the night the roaring of the water-torrents re-echoed loudly from the rocky
hills.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;We learned that the indigo cultivation is not very
laborious.&nbsp; The seed is scattered over the ground, and then the people
turn the streams over the surface for inundation.&nbsp; There is no
ploughing.&nbsp; This is done directly after barley-harvest from the same
ground.&nbsp; There is no produce for two years, but after that period the
same stalks successively for five years produce about
seventy-two-fold.&nbsp; I bought a timnah (measure) of the seed for
curiosity, to deposit in our museum.</p>
<p>We finished breakfast, had the tents struck, and the mules laden, all
before the sky began to look red, announcing the coming sun.</p>
<p>The castle of &rsquo;Ajloon was a very conspicuous object on the
mountainous horizon of the east.</p>
<p>I then spent about three hours in exploring the Roman antiquities of the
place when it bore the name of Scythopolis.&nbsp; These are all contained
within or along a natural basin, of which I here give a rough map.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p98.jpg">
<img alt="Scythopolis" src="images/p98.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>The general form is that of an oval, the centre of which has four
pediments for the arch of a bridge, or a triumphal arch, over a rivulet
that traverses the whole obliquely.&nbsp; From this central square of four
pediments extends right and left one long colonnade, or dromos.&nbsp;
Within the basin, but on the south bank of the water, is the theatre; on
the north, and outside of the oval, is the lofty mound, surmounted by
fortified buildings, forming the acropolis, the <i>Hhus&rsquo;n</i>, which
is visible for miles and miles over the country.&nbsp; In the S.E. corner
is the modern village&mdash;a very insignificant one, but with remains of a
Christian church, for I should suppose the Moslems never built so good a
mosque at Beis&acirc;n.&nbsp; Of course the present inhabitants use it for
their devotions.&nbsp; The building is all angular, with a square tower at
the south end.&nbsp; The principal doorway&mdash;that at the north
end&mdash;is perforated into a walled-up large pointed arch.</p>
<p>The principal object of my curiosity was the theatre, which, like all
those of the Romans and Greeks, is a building of nearly a semicircle in
form, with the extremities connected by a chord or straight line; this
latter was the <i>proscenium</i> or stage, and is near 200 feet in
length.&nbsp; Upon the ground-plan, at half distance from the centre to the
outer curve, the <i>vomitories</i> or passages for entrance and exit begin,
leaving an open area; these are formed in concentric semicircles, divided
across by radii, all coming from the one centre.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Over these passages the seats for spectators are constructed,
rising higher as approaching to the outer curve&mdash;and the dens for the
wild beasts, when they were to be exhibited, were under the front
seats.&nbsp; The vomitories are of the most perfect design for utility, and
still remain in complete preservation, all vaulted over with admirable
workmanship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p100.jpg">
<img alt="Ground plan of the Theatre" src="images/p100.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I looked about in vain for the indentings in front of the rows of seats
which had held the <i>&rsquo;&Eta;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</i> or brazen
saucers, which indentings are stated to have been seen by Irby and Mangles;
but we know that the <i>&rsquo;&Eta;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</i> were so
placed in ancient theatres for increasing the power of voice uttered upon
the stage.</p>
<p>The front blocks of the stage are white, and these are brought from a
distance.&nbsp; They measure eight feet by four each.&nbsp; But the
peculiarity of the general building lies in its being built of the black
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>stone of the country adjacent.&nbsp; I afterwards saw Roman
theatres at Amm&acirc;n and Umm Kais, as already mentioned in the journey
&ldquo;Over the Jordan,&rdquo; but they were white; and another at Petra,
but that was of rosy red.&nbsp; All the three&mdash;the black, the white,
and the red&mdash;were each of its own one colour, without intermixture of
others, except that here the stage was of another colour from the rest of
the building.</p>
<p>I then prepared to mount to the acropolis or Hhus&rsquo;n.&nbsp; The
hill is shaped as an oblong square, sloping downwards, and rounded at the
four edges.&nbsp; Steps have been cut into it for ascending from below.</p>
<p>Arriving at what appears from below to be the summit, but is not, I
found a large platform, improved by art, with remains of houses and
cisterns, and surrounded at the edge by a parapet wall five feet
thick,&mdash;except at the eastern end, opposite to the present town, where
one-third of the hill has been left rising considerably higher, and
therefore a wall is not required.</p>
<p>In this wall, at the N.W. side, I found remains of a very massive
gateway, with fragments of older columns and friezes built up into the side
work.&nbsp; At this spot the rising hill above is particularly
precipitous.&nbsp; I climbed to the extreme summit, but found there no
remains of human labour.&nbsp; The view, however, as may be supposed, amply
repaid the exertion.&nbsp; In one direction the prolonged Gh&ocirc;r <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>of the
Jordan; and in another appeared the opening of the plain of Esdraelon and
Tabor, with the Mediterranean far away, and Carmel almost hull down, as one
might say of a ship.&nbsp; In the nearer distance were lines of black Arab
tents, an old khan, ruins of water-mills, and rushing rivulets in
abundance, the sources of which lie so high in the adjacent hills of
Gilboa, that the town and the irrigation of the district are supplied from
them copiously.</p>
<p>I picked up some tesser&aelig; about the acropolis hill, but I saw none
elsewhere near Beis&acirc;n,&mdash;discovered no inscriptions, and heard of
no coins.</p>
<p>Close to the town there were thick layers of calcareous sediment,
containing petrified reeds or canes, of which I brought away specimens for
our museum.</p>
<p>Thus ended my inspection of this really interesting place, so remarkable
for being all built of black volcanic stone,&mdash;the theatre, the church,
and the modern village, besides the rocks all about: add to this the vile
appearance of the people, and one cannot wonder at visitors entertaining a
dread and disgust at the whole.&mdash;I find that I have omitted to mention
the mineral quality of the water, the most of which is undrinkable.</p>
<p>We left Beis&acirc;n at half-past nine, after examining it more
completely than the published accounts of former travellers lead us to
believe they have done.&nbsp; Thomson&rsquo;s account is of later date.</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Our journey now lay due north, along the Gh&ocirc;r to Tiberias;
and a very pleasing journey it proved to be.</p>
<p>In half an hour we had to ford a pretty wide stream, and in five minutes
more were among very extensive ruins of an ancient town; upon a tumulus at
its farther extremity are lying portions of three huge sarcophagi, and a
portion of a thick column.&nbsp; This must be the &ldquo;Es Soudah,&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i>, <i>black</i>,) mentioned by Thomson&mdash;indeed, all ruins
of that district are of black basalt, excepting the columns and
sarcophagi.&nbsp; The name <i>soda</i> or <i>black</i> occurs in English as
a synonym for <i>alkali</i>, and means the black or dark-coloured ashes of
the plant <i>al-kali</i> when burnt for use&mdash;the white colour of it
seen in Europe is obtained by chemical preparation.</p>
<p>Black tents and fires of the kali burners were visible in many
directions&mdash;a delicious breeze blowing in our faces; but above
everything cheerful was the green line of the Jordan banks.&nbsp; No snow
to be seen at present at that distance upon Hermon.&nbsp; At half-past
eleven we were beneath some castellated remains of great extent, namely,
the Crusaders&rsquo; <i>Belvoir</i>, now called <i>Cocab el Hawa</i>.&nbsp;
Our ground had become gradually more undulated; then hilly, and the
Gh&ocirc;r narrowed: we were obliged to cross it diagonally towards the
Jordan; forded a running stream abounding in oleander, where, according to
his usual custom, my Egyptian servant took a handful of the flowers to wear
in his <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>waistcoat.&nbsp; Then the birds carolling so happily, recalling
the well-known lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And Jordan, those sweet banks of thine,<br />
With woods so full of nightingales.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The songsters that I heard were certainly neither the linnets nor
goldfinches of other parts of Palestine, but must have been the
<i>bulbul</i>, the note of which, though rich and tender in expression, is
not however the same with that of English nightingales.</p>
<p>Then we came to the bridge called <i>Jis&rsquo;r el
Mej&acirc;ma&rsquo;a</i>, which is in tolerably good condition, with one
large and several smaller arches in two rows, and a dilapidated khan at the
western end.&nbsp; I crossed over the bridge into the territory of
Gilead.</p>
<p>The khan has been a strong edifice, but the stones of the massive
gateway, especially the great keystone, are split across, as if from the
effects of gunpowder.</p>
<p>When that bridge was erected, the country must have been in safe and
prosperous circumstances; the beauty of the scenery was not found in
contrast to the happiness of the people; there must have been rich commerce
carried on between the far east and the towns of Palestine; and it is in
reference to such a fortunate period that the wandering minstrels, even now
among the Bedaween, sing the songs of the forty orphan youths who competed
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>in
poetic compositions under the influence of love for an Arab maiden at the
bridge of Mej&acirc;ma&rsquo;a.</p>
<p>The name is derived from the <i>meeting</i> of two branches of the
Jordan in that place after having separated above.&nbsp; Below the bridge
the bed of the river is very rocky, and the course of the water disturbed,
but above the &ldquo;meeting of the waters&rdquo; all is beautifully smooth
and tranquil; wild aquatic birds enjoying their existence on its surface,
and the banks fringed with willows and oleanders.&nbsp; How grateful is all
this to the traveller after a scorching ride of several hours.</p>
<p>Then the river, and with it our road, deflected back to the western
hills; again the river wound in serpentine sinuosities about the middle of
the plain, with little islands and shallow sands within its course.&nbsp; I
am not sure that the delight we experienced was not enhanced by the
circumstance of travelling upwards against stream.&nbsp; Whenever tourists
find the country safe enough for the purpose, and have leisure at command,
I certainly recommend to them this district of Jordan, between Beis&acirc;n
and Tiberias: of course this presupposes that they visit Nazareth before or
afterwards.</p>
<p>Occasionally we came to rings of stones laid on the ground,&mdash;these
mark the graves of Arabs of the vicinity; then a cattle enclosure, fenced
in by a bank of earth, and thorns piled on the top.&nbsp; All about this
were subterranean granaries for corn, having apertures like wells, but
empty.&nbsp; Close to <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>this was a ford to the eastern bank.&nbsp; The
river has many interruptions certainly, but yet in two days&rsquo; ride we
had seen a good deal of smooth water for boating.&nbsp; At half-past one
was reached the village of <i>Abad&icirc;yeh</i>.</p>
<p>Near the village we saw people cutting twigs of tamarisk and
willow.&nbsp; At the village were large plantations of the kitchen
vegetable, <i>Bamia</i>, which is a <i>hibiscus</i>, (called <i>ochra</i>
in the West Indies,) the plants four feet high, with bright yellow
blossom.&nbsp; Near the regular houses were suburb huts made of
reeds.&nbsp; This is often seen along the Gh&ocirc;r; they are tenanted by
wanderers at certain seasons of the year.</p>
<p>There was a profusion of good wheat straw lying wasting upon the ground;
it is here too plentiful to be cared for.</p>
<p>We saw afterwards a low wall of masonry entirely crossing the Jordan,
but having now a broken aperture in the middle.&nbsp; In former times these
artificial works were common, and served to irrigate the lands on each
side.&nbsp; The river was never used for navigation.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock we reached one well-known rendezvous, the old
broken bridge, popularly called &ldquo;Mother of Arches.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
ford was now low in water.&nbsp; Here we rested under a neb&rsquo;k tree;
and on getting out the luncheon, discovered that all our stores of bread,
coffee, sugar, and arrow-root had been soaked by the splashing of streams
and fords that we had this day encountered.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>The horseman fell again to his prayers.&nbsp; Several Arabs from
the Hauran with their camels, crossed the Jordan while we were there.</p>
<p>Another hour took us to the baths of Tiberias; the heat very great, and
by our roadside there was a whole mountain with its dry yellow grass and
weeds on fire.</p>
<p>Near the south end of the lake are some palms growing wild.&nbsp; We
dismounted at a quarter to four.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Next day I ascended the hills to Safed, a well-known station.&nbsp; The
place is exceedingly healthy, enjoying the purest mountain air, as is
evinced by the healthy complexion of the numerous Jews residing there; and
the landscape views are both extensive and beautiful.</p>
<p>On the following day I undertook a few hours&rsquo; excursion to
<i>Kadis</i> (Kedesh Naphtali), where Barak, son of Abinoam, and Deborah,
collected the forces of Zebulun and Naphtali, for marching to Mount Tabor
against Sisera.&nbsp; It was also one of the six cities of refuge for cases
of unintentional homicide, (Josh. xx. 7;) it lies to the N.N.E. from
Safed.</p>
<p>In an hour we obtained a grand view of Hermon just opposite to us, and
never lost sight of it till our return.&nbsp; Passed between the villages
of <i>Dil&acirc;thah</i> on the right, and <i>Taitaba</i> on the left; the
country is all strewn with volcanic basalt.&nbsp; In another <!-- page
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>half-hour we
had <i>Ras el Ahhmar</i> on our left.&nbsp; Then <i>F&acirc;rah</i> and
<i>Salhhah</i> at some distance to the left, and <i>Alma</i> just before
us.&nbsp; The volcanic brown stones had on them occasionally a thin lichen
of either orange colour, or a sour pale green, like verdigris.</p>
<p>About this village were women and children gathering olives from the
trees&mdash;first beating the boughs with poles, then picking up the fruit
from the ground.</p>
<p>The small district around here is named &ldquo;the Khait,&rdquo; and the
people boast of its extraordinary fertility in corn-produce.</p>
<p>Down a steep descent of white limestone, where it is said the torrents
are so strong in winter that no one attempts to pass that way.&nbsp; Rising
again, we found near the summit of the opposite hill a spring of water,
from which some Bedaween women were carrying away water in the common
fashion, in goat-skins upon their backs.&nbsp; They were young, pretty,
dirty, and ragged.&nbsp; Of course their rags were blue, and their lips
were coloured to match.</p>
<p>Pleasant breeze springing up after the heat of the day.&nbsp; Corn
stubble on the fields, and fine olive plantations, as we got near to Kadis,
our place of destination; with such a wide clear road up to it, as might
seem to be traditionally preserved as such from ancient times, if the
Talmud be relied upon when it gives the legal width of various kinds of
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>roads, and prescribes twice as much for a highway towards the
cities of refuge, as for any other description of road. <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a></p>
<p>The scenery around Kadis is cheerful, but the village itself consisted
of only about half-a-dozen wretched houses.&nbsp; In passing by these,
towards an orchard at the farther side, we saw some large ancient
sarcophagi,&mdash;three of them lying side by side, but broken, and some
capitals of columns.</p>
<p>After selecting our site for the tents, and setting the cook to work in
his peculiar vocation, not forgetting to see that the horses were being
attended, we procured a guide to conduct us down the hill to the
antiquities.</p>
<p>There are still evidences remaining that the old city had been wealthy
and celebrated&mdash;squared stones lying profusely about.&nbsp; At the
spring of water: this was received into an embellished <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>sarcophagus for a
trough, and adjoining to it a spacious paved reservoir.</p>
<p>Here began a series of highly ornamental public edifices and sepulchral
monuments.&nbsp; We went first to the farthest; and there it was greatly to
be regretted that there was not with us an artist able to do justice to the
exceeding beauty of the remains.</p>
<p>It was a large oblong building, placed east and west, an ornamental
moulding running round the whole at four feet from the ground; the roof
fallen in.&nbsp; At the eastern extremity have been three portals, of which
the middle one was by far the largest; each of these decorated richly by a
bead and scroll moulding.&nbsp; The lintel of the principal gate has fallen
from its place, and now stands perpendicular, leaning against one of the
uprights: this is one stone of fifteen feet in length, beautifully
sculptured.&nbsp; Some broken pillars are lying about, and several
magnificent Corinthian capitals of square pilasters, which had been
alongside of the principal portal.&nbsp; I have never seen anywhere in
Palestine any relic of so pure a Grecian taste as this temple. <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a></p>
<p>Nearer to the town is a Roman erection of large well-cut stones, which
have acquired from the effects of time the fine yellow tinge which is <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>remarkable on the relic of the Church of St John Baptist at
Sebustieh. <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a></p>
<p>This was a smaller building than the other, and is nearly entire, except
that the roof is fallen in.&nbsp; It is in a square form: at each corner is
a solid square of masonry thirty feet high, and these are connected with
each other by semi-circular arches, two of which are fallen, and the other
two have their keystones dangling almost in the air, so slight is the hold
of their voussoirs to keep them from falling.&nbsp; The walls rise half way
up these abutments; the doorway is to the south, and has the ports and
lintel richly decorated.&nbsp; Of the use of this erection I could form no
judgment.</p>
<p>Between the two edifices was a mass of solid masonry, supporting a
sarcophagus nearly ten feet long, with a double sarcophagus of the same
dimensions at each side of it: not only the middle single one, but each
double sarcophagus, was formed of one stone each.&nbsp; Can we doubt of the
relation which the persons buried in the double ones bore to each
other?&nbsp; The sides of these stone coffins are highly adorned with
floral garlands, and the lids are lying broken across beside them.</p>
<p>Oh! vain expectation, to preserve the human frame from violation, by
elaborate and durable monuments!&nbsp; There is but one safe repository for
the decaying part of man, and that is what the Almighty Maker at first
decreed&mdash;namely, earth <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>to earth, ashes to ashes, and dust to
dust.&nbsp; The poorest slave, buried in a hole within the ground, is safer
from man&rsquo;s greed and violence than the mightiest conqueror; for the
massive porphyry sarcophagus of Alexander was rifled by Caligula, and after
that by others, in Egypt.&nbsp; And the same fate has befallen the tombs of
Cyrus and Darius in Persia, for the sake of the riches entombed with
them.</p>
<p>Some copper coins were brought to us, but of no particular value: they
were either corroded or broken, and of no remarkable antiquity.</p>
<p>As twilight faded away we returned to the tents, and had the evening
meal.&nbsp; The wind rose considerably, so that we lighted a fire on the
lee side of my tent, and gazed round upon the strange and noble scene
around.&nbsp; There was Hermon just before us, seen indistinctly by
starlight; and there was sufficient novelty and non-security in the place
to keep attention awake.</p>
<p>The shaikh of the village came and assured us that in the Lebanon (not
far distant) the Druses were up; that the convent at Maal&ucirc;leh had
been sacked, and twenty-two Emirs had been seized by the beastly Turks (as
he denominated them); that Abu Neked was up in arms, and even the villages
in the south, about Nazareth, were fighting.&nbsp; Of course there was
considerable exaggeration in all this, but our muleteer began to pray that
he might be soon safe again in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>The shaikh informed us that in the happy time of the Egyptian
rule, under Ibrahim Pasha, his village was so populous that they cultivated
fifty feddans of land, whereas now they could only work six; that then
property was so safe that Arab marauders were always caught and punished,
(he had himself had Bedaween kept prisoners in his house,) whereas now,
under the Turks, they come into his house to steal.</p>
<p>While he was relating this, a man came running from the village to
announce that neighbouring Arabs were just before carrying off some of
their cows in the dark, but on being pursued, had made off without
them.</p>
<p>After I got to bed, one of our people shot at a hy&aelig;na, and the
villagers shouted from the roofs of their houses to know if we were
attacked.&nbsp; In the morning they told us that they had seen the
hy&aelig;na, big enough to eat a man, and that their attention had been
attracted to it by the cry of an owl.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>November</i> 2.&mdash;We returned towards Safed over
the plain of <i>Alma</i>.&nbsp; The wheat of this district is renowned far
and wide for quality and quantity of produce.&nbsp; The guide told us that
at this place were splendid remains of antiquity; but, on arriving, we
could hear of nothing but a poor cistern within a cavern.&nbsp; Here the
black basalt recommences after the region of white limestone where we had
been; and then again, at the distance of a good-sized field, we were upon
common <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>brown agricultural soil.&nbsp; It is curious how sharply these
division-lines of soil are drawn in every direction about this place. 
<p>Thence we diverged off from yesterday&rsquo;s road to visit <i>Jish</i>,
passing through Ras el Ahhmar.&nbsp; Most magnificent views of Hermon and
Anti-Lebanon.</p>
<p>Had to go down into a valley, through which, on a former journey, we had
passed on coming from <i>Bint Jebail</i>, and visited again the ancient
monument in a vineyard by the roadside.&nbsp; It appears to have consisted
of one small building.&nbsp; The lower parts of two upright posts of its
doorway remain, together with a fragment of the transverse lintel: several
pieces of columns are lying about, and pediments of these <i>in
situ</i>.&nbsp; Besides these, there is the following fragment of
sculpture</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p114.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient sepulchre near Jish" src="images/p114.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>nearly level with the ground, and is probably the entrance of a
sepulchre, but we had no opportunity of clearing away the soil to ascertain
that.&nbsp; The ornamentation seems to be that of laurel leaves.&nbsp; Near
adjoining is a fragment of a round pillar, partly buried; but on seeing
Hebrew writing upon it, I cleared it away partly.&nbsp; Some of it was but
indistinct.&nbsp; I could only read it thus&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p115.jpg">
<img alt="Hebrew writing" src="images/p115.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&mdash;from which not much signification can be gathered.&nbsp; Perhaps
some cracks in the stone have disfigured the characters; but how and when
did a Hebrew inscription come in such a place?&nbsp; The site is very
agreeable, with streamlets of water tinkling among trees by the
roadside.</p>
<p>Thence we mounted up to the village of <i>Jish</i>, the place of <i>John
of Giscala</i>, the antagonist of Josephus.&nbsp; This seems to have been
the centre-point of the dreadful earthquake in 1837, from which <!-- page
116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Safed and
Tiberias suffered so much.&nbsp; It occurred on the New Year&rsquo;s day,
while the people of the village were all in church; and just as the priest
held the sacramental cup in his hand, the whole village was in a moment
destroyed, not one soul being left alive but the priest himself, and,
humanly speaking, his preservation was owing to the arch above his
head.&nbsp; All the villages around shared the same fate, and the greater
part of the towns above mentioned.&nbsp; Much damage was sustained all over
Palestine; and a heart-rending description of the events has since been
printed, though little known in England, by a Christian Israelite, named
Calman, who, together with Thomson, the American missionary, hasted from
Bayroot on hearing of the calamity, and aided in saving many lives of
persons buried beneath the ruins of Safed and Tiberias, during several days
after the catastrophe.</p>
<p>This sad event serves for an era to date from; and the Jews there, when
referring to past occurrences, are accustomed to say, it was so many years
before (or after) the &#1513;&#1506;&#1512; (the earthquake.)</p>
<p>Among the ruins of Jish are no remains of antiquity, except a fragment
of the thick shaft of a column and a small sarcophagus, only large enough
for a child, in a field half a mile distant.&nbsp; The Jews appropriate
this to Shemaiah Abtelin.</p>
<p>We passed between <i>Kadita</i> and <i>Taitaba</i>, over land strewn
with volcanic stone, beginning near Jish and extending almost to those
villages.&nbsp; The <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>crater, of very remote times, noticed by
Robinson, is about one-third of the distance from Jish to Safed; not very
imposing in appearance.</p>
<p>The journey from Kadis to Safed is one of five hours&rsquo; common
travelling.&nbsp; We reached the olive ground encampment shortly before
noon.&nbsp; Being the Jewish Sabbath, there was the <i>Eruv</i> suspended
at the exits of the principal streets.&nbsp; This is an invention of the
Talmudists, used in unwalled towns, being a line extended from one post to
another, indicating to Jews what is the limit which they are to consider as
the town-wall, and certain ordinances of the Sabbath are regulated
thereby.</p>
<p>A strong wind from the south blew up a mist that almost concealed the
huge dark ravine of <i>Jarmuk</i>, but the night became once more hot and
still.</p>
<p>3<i>d</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;And rested the Sabbath-day, according to the
commandment,&rdquo;&mdash;neither the principal prayer-day of the
Mohammedans, which is Friday, nor the Sabbath-day of the large population
of Jews about me, but that which the early Christians so beautifully named
the Lord&rsquo;s-day, while observing it as a Sabbath.&nbsp; I attended
divine service in the English language at the house of Mr Daniel, the
missionary to the Jews: we were six in number.&nbsp; The rest of the day
was spent in quiet reading and meditation, with visits at one time from the
rabbis, and at another from the missionary.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;An excursion to <i>Meroon</i> to visit the <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>sepulchres
of several eminent canonized rabbis.&nbsp; The Jews believe this place to
be the Shimron-Meron of Joshua xii. 20.&nbsp; An odd party we formed: there
were the missionary and his lady, Polish rabbis with very broad beaver hats
and curled ringlets on each side of the face, a crowd of Jewish idlers
walking, the Moslem attendants, and a peasant of the village we were going
to.&nbsp; Certainly the rabbinical riding was not of a very dashing
character: their reverences were all mounted on asses with mean
accoutrements, for the adjustment of which they often had to
dismount.&nbsp; Our place of destination lies at the foot of the great hill
Jarmuk, and the road to it is very rough, with broken rocks fallen from the
summit; but the place commands a grand prospect of Safed and the Lake of
Galilee.</p>
<p>The first object of interest was of course the sepulchre of Rabbi Simeon
bar Jochai, the patron saint of this region, and of regions beyond.&nbsp;
He lived a miraculous life in the second Christian century; wrote the
famous book (Zohar), by which, if I mistake not, the Cabbalists still work
miracles; and miracles are performed in answer to prayers at his
tomb&mdash;so it is believed; and his commemoration festival, in the month
Iyar (see <i>ante</i>) is attended by Jewish votaries from all parts of the
world, many of whom practise the heathen rite of burning precious objects,
such as gold lace, Cashmere shawls, etc., upon the tomb, to propitiate his
favour.&nbsp; On these occasions scenes of scandalous <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>licence and riot are
witnessed, and sometimes lives are lost in conflicts with Moslems begun in
drunkenness.&nbsp; The rabbis, however, procure great gains from the annual
festival or fair.</p>
<p>(In the town of Safed there is at least one (perhaps more) <i>Beth
ha-Midrash</i>, a sort of synagogue, with perpetual endowment, for reading
of the Zohar day and night for ever.)</p>
<p>First we entered a court-yard with a walnut-tree in the midst.&nbsp; At
a farther corner of this court is a small clean apartment, with a lighted
lamp in a frame suspended from the ceiling, which is capable of holding
more lamps.&nbsp; In a corner of this apartment is a recess with a lamp
burning before it; in this a roll of the law is kept; it is the shrine
itself of the author of Zohar.&nbsp; One of our rabbis retired behind us
for prayer.&nbsp; In another part of this chamber is buried Eleazar, son of
the illustrious Simeon.</p>
<p>These sepulchres are marked out upon the roof, outside of the chamber,
by a small pillar over each, with a hollow on the top of it for burning of
the votive offerings as above mentioned.&nbsp; Near the first entrance gate
is a similar pillar for lamps and offerings vowed to Rabbi Isaac, a
celebrated physician.</p>
<p>All these three saints still perform as many miracles as ever they did;
and the common people believe that any person forcing an entrance to the
shrines, without express permission of the living rabbis, will be
infallibly punished with <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>sudden death.&nbsp; They cited instances of
such visitations having occurred.</p>
<p>We then went to the ruin of what the Jews assert to have been a
synagogue.&nbsp; It has been an oblong square building, one of its sides
being formed by the scarped surface of a rock, and its opposite (the north)
stands upon what is now the brink of a low precipice, probably from the
earth having given way below at the time of the earthquake; indeed it must
be so, for the one of the three portals at the east end, which was there,
is now missing.&nbsp; The floor is solid surface of rock, and now used by
the peasants for a thrashing-floor.&nbsp; The portals have been handsome,
with bold mouldings; but no floral embellishment or inscription now
remains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p120.jpg">
<img alt="Possible synagogue" src="images/p120.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The transverse lintels are each of one stone; the central one is at
least fifteen feet in length.</p>
<p>Persons still living remember this building very much more entire than
it now is.&nbsp; There is an abundance of large loose stones lying about,
and fragments of broken columns or moulded friezes.&nbsp; Upon the rock by
its side is a small tower that <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>was erected by old Daher (Volney&rsquo;s hero
of the Report on Syria) in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The village population now consists of about thirty souls, friendly to
the Jews, from whom indeed they derive their principal subsistence, in
consideration of guarding the sanctuaries from spoliation.&nbsp; Other
sanctified rabbis are interred in sites about the village and the hill. 
<p>After a temperate luncheon upon the rocks among the noble scenery in the
open air, and consulting the Hebrew book of travels of R. Joseph Schwartz,
(who was still living in Jerusalem,) we parted from our rabbis, and
proceeded to visit Cuf&rsquo;r Bera&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>When we arrived close to <i>Sasa</i>, there was <i>Jish</i> before us on
the right.&nbsp; We passed through a district of stones and underwood of
evergreen oak; clouds and rain coming on, which overtook us sharply as we
reached the village.</p>
<p>Some of the party being but poor riders, we were later than I had
expected to be; it was quite sunset; and the people of the place, (almost
all of them Maronite Christians,) headed by their priest could do no less
than press us to stay through the night with them, especially as the sky
threatened a continuation of rain.&nbsp; After deliberative counsel being
taken among us, it was resolved that we could only thank the good people
for their intended <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>hospitality, and return home.&nbsp; We first
halted before an ancient square building, the outside of which has been
much encroached upon by the alluvial earth of ages, and the simple but
correct Tuscan portico, encumbered with piles of fagots for the village use
during the approaching winter.&nbsp; The three doorways of the
fa&ccedil;ade were embellished by sculptured wreaths of vine leaves and
grapes.&nbsp; Hearing that some Hebrew inscription was to be found beneath
one of the windows, we had some of the fagots removed, sufficient to enable
us to read the words &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; &#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;
(this house, etc.); but on account of the labour required to do more with
such a tangled and heavy mass of wood, besides the rain and the lateness of
the hour, we were obliged to abandon the task, and go forward to the large
decorated portal which is standing alone, without its edifice, in an
enclosed field at about a quarter of a mile distant.&nbsp; This is erected
upon a raised platform of masonry.&nbsp; Upon the transverse lintel we read
the following Hebrew inscription, neatly engraved:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p122b.jpg">
<img alt="Hebrew inscription" src="images/p122b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>(Peace be within this place, and all places of the sojourners . . . to
the work . . . blessing in his works.)</p>
<p>This is all written in one line, without breaks or stops, very small,
and in as neat a square character as if lately copied from a printed
book.&nbsp; The two uprights and the lintel have a <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>simple and chaste
ornament like a bead moulding.&nbsp; The transverse lintel has in the
middle of its length a rosette surmounted by a circular wreath, at each end
of which may be seen upon close inspection, and in a slanting light, traces
of a small animal, most likely a sheep, recumbent, which have been
chiselled away.&nbsp; On a visit some years after, and on closer
inspection, I remarked the same figures upon the fa&ccedil;ade of that
building above mentioned, with Tuscan pillars for a portico, though pains
have been taken, as in this instance, to obliterate them.</p>
<p>The ground all about there is strewn with moulded stones and broken
columns.</p>
<p>We reached Safed, cold and wet, in the dark, having ridden but slowly,
in order to accommodate certain individuals of the party; but it was in the
month of November, at an altitude of above 2000 feet, with rain and gusts
of wind coming between dark mountains.</p>
<p>My evening reflections alone naturally ran upon the almost unknown
circumstance of Hebrew inscriptions existing upon remains of ancient and
decorated edifices in this part of the country, while nothing of the sort
is known elsewhere.&nbsp; Were the two buildings at Cuf&rsquo;r
Bera&rsquo;am, and the sepulchre in the field below Jish, really Jewish?
and if so, when were they erected?</p>
<p>The modern Jews, in their utter ignorance of chronology, declare these
to be synagogues of the time of the second temple in Jerusalem; and <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>affirm
that, notwithstanding the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, this
province of Upper Galilee remained without its people being led into
captivity, and that many families (for instance, the Jewish agriculturists
still at Bokeea&rsquo;, between Safed and Acre) continue now, just as they
were then, in the same localities.</p>
<p>My good old friend Nicolayson, the late missionary to the Jews, was
willing to believe a good deal about this local stability of Jews in Upper
Galilee, and to give credit for a state of much prosperity among the Jews
in the East during the reigns of the Antonine emperors; and his idea was
the most probable one of any that I have heard advanced&mdash;namely, that
these edifices (corresponding in general character with those remaining at
Kadis) are really synagogues from the era of the Antonines, and that the
inscriptions are of the same date; meanwhile keeping in mind that they are
utterly wanting in the robust style of archaic Hebraism, and that the
embellishments indicate somewhat of a low period.</p>
<p>For myself, after two visits to the place, and many years of
consideration, I cannot bring myself to this belief; but rather conclude
that they were heathen temples of the Antonine epoch, and afterwards used
as synagogues by the Jews, long ago&mdash;probably during some interval of
tranquillity under the early Mohammedans,&mdash;and that the Hebrew
inscriptions were then put upon them.</p>
<p>There is some regularity and method in the <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>writing upon the
lonely portal in the field, though even this is not so well executed as the
contiguous moulding upon the same stone; but the other two inscriptions
(those upon the facade of the building in the village, and that upon the
broken column in the field below Jish) are put irregularly upon any vacant
space that happened to be unencumbered.&nbsp; I am convinced that, in the
latter instance, the sculpture and the writing have nothing to do with each
other.</p>
<p>The surest demonstration, however, to my mind, lies in the evident fact
of animal figures having been originally upon the same lintel where the
writing now is.&nbsp; Although their relief-projection has been chiselled
down, the outlines of the figures are unmistakable.&nbsp; These, I feel
certain, were coeval with the buildings, while the inscriptions are only
coeval with their being defaced.</p>
<p>Next day we travelled southwards towards Jerusalem.&nbsp; On leaving the
town we passed the ruins of an old church, which they call &ldquo;The
Church of the Forty Martyrs,&rdquo; (this seems to be a favourite
traditional designation, as there are other such about the country) and in
half an hour reached a stream in the midst of a wood of neb&rsquo;k trees,
where an Arab, riding a fine mare and carrying a long spear decorated with
black ostrich feathers, was driving a cow across the water&mdash;very
probably plundered from some neighbouring village.</p>
<p>At <i>Yakook</i>&mdash;the dirtiest place in the world, I <!-- page

there was a large Arab encampment, the men sitting apart from the women,
and cooking going on&mdash;thence to <i>Hhatteen</i>.&nbsp; The volcanic
stones of this region are far blacker than elsewhere; the district
resembles some dismal coal district in the north of England.&nbsp; Thence
out of the common road to <i>Nimrin</i>, by <i>Lubieh</i>,
<i>Tura&rsquo;&acirc;n</i>, to <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Cana</i>, the old and true
Cana of Galilee.</p>
<p>At this village of peculiarly scriptural interest, the women and
children were spreading cotton pods, just picked, on their house-roofs to
dry.&nbsp; Here is a square-built cistern filled from a spring within it,
and the cattle were drinking from a beautiful sarcophagus.&nbsp; Losing our
road again we came to <i>Meshhad</i>, rather west of the usual road.&nbsp;
Clouds lowering and frowning over Carmel.&nbsp; At the village of
<i>Raineh</i> I noticed a man harrowing a ploughed field by dragging a
bunch of prickly-pear leaves after a yoke of oxen.&nbsp; Arrived at
Nazareth.</p>
<p>Next day, across the plain of Esdraelon to <i>Jeneen</i> and
<i>Sanoor</i>, where we slept.&nbsp; Then by a new road, untraversed by
Europeans.&nbsp; After <i>Jeba&rsquo;</i>, we got into the plain of Sharon,
through the large olive plantations of <i>Fendecom&icirc;a</i>,
(<i>pente</i>, five, and <i>comai</i>, villages&mdash;in Greek,) between
<i>Yaero</i>, (a ruin,) <i>Adjah</i>, <i>Rameeen</i>, and <i>Attarah</i>,
with other villages in good condition.&nbsp; Saw Cuf&rsquo;r Ra&rsquo;i
very distinctly at a distance in the West, and numerous villages
besides.</p>
<p>From an eminence we looked down upon an extensive prospect of shaded
unoccupied hills, with <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the wide plain beyond and the Mediterranean
Sea; then descended into a valley, the road winding about through immense
olive groves; the travelling was easy, and all the district bore the
appearance of prosperity, such as could hardly be expected where we know
that factious warfare so frequently exists.&nbsp; Passed <i>Cuf&rsquo;r
Rum&acirc;n</i>.&nbsp; As far as <i>&rsquo;Ann&acirc;beh</i> the course had
been for a long time westwards; but there, at the opening of the great
plain, we turned due southwards.&nbsp; This was four hours from
<i>Sanoor</i>, at a good pace.&nbsp; Passed between
<i>&rsquo;Ann&acirc;beh</i> and <i>Tool el Ker&rsquo;m</i> in changing our
course.&nbsp; Near <i>Irtahh</i> we passed a camel-party going down to
Egypt with bales of soap and tobacco for sale.&nbsp; We were upon the
established route of trade between Damascus and Egypt, and not very far
distant from Dothan, where the Midianite or Ishmaelite caravan bought
Joseph from his brethren; but we had passed this on our left hand in the
morning.</p>
<p>Soon passed <i>Farra&rsquo;an</i> on our left, with a weli and a cistern
below it, by the roadside.&nbsp; <i>Kalins&acirc;wa</i> in sight, but far
away to the right; <i>Ferd&icirc;sia</i> and <i>Zen&acirc;beh</i> on the
left.&nbsp; The day very hot, and the peasantry observed to be, as usual in
all the Philistine country, cleaner in their garments than those of the
mountains.</p>
<p>Coasted along, parallel to the line of hills, as far as
<i>Kalkeeleh</i>, where we began to turn inwards, across the fields,
towards the place of our destination, namely, <i>Mejdal Yaba</i>, which was
conspicuous <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>on an eminence before us.&nbsp; This was at six and a half hours
from <i>Sanoor</i>.</p>
<p>In a field we arrived at a well, where the water must have been very low
down, being late in the year; for it was only obtained by jars or skins
drawn up at the end of a very long rope, worked by a long line of women
walking across the field, and singing at their work, while the men sat
looking on and smoking.</p>
<p>We passed the remains of some old considerable town, where, among the
fallen building stones and the lines of foundations, there was a cistern,
and an ancient sarcophagus by its side; also a deep square well filled up
with rubbish, and remains of quarrying work in the solid
rock,&mdash;besides an unroofed building, with a semicircular arch to the
doorway.&nbsp; Surely this must have been of Roman construction.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Mejdal Yaba</i> in nine hours from Sanoor,&mdash;a hot and
tiring journey.&nbsp; At a short distance below us was the site of <i>Ras
el &rsquo;Ain</i>; and farther westwards, but within sight, the tall white
tower of <i>Ramlah</i>.&nbsp; Time&mdash;sunset.</p>
<p>I had a special object in coming off the common high-roads to this
place, but little known, at that time not at all known, to
Europeans,&mdash;namely, to visit Shaikh Sadek, the responsible ruler of
the district, and regarded by the peasantry with especial deference, out of
traditional obedience to his ancient family.</p>
<p>We found the village and the castle in a very dilapidated condition, and
the great shaikh not at <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>home.&nbsp; Some of his relatives, however,
received us; but both they and the peasantry were surprised, if not
alarmed, at our coming.&nbsp; To them it seemed as if we were suddenly
dropped upon them from the sky.&nbsp; Perhaps they had never seen Europeans
before; or they might have thought us spies sent by the Turkish
Government.&nbsp; There were plenty of idle fellows lounging about; but
their supplies of food from the village were scanty, and of inferior
quality.</p>
<p>The S&acirc;dek family apologised for apparent want of
hospitality,&mdash;explaining that the only unbroken part of the castle was
but just sufficient to contain the <i>hareem</i> of the women, and there
was not a single room to give me.&nbsp; So I was glad to have my bedding
and other paraphernalia spread upon a <i>mustabah</i>, or raised stone
divan, just within the gate.&nbsp; A narrow vaulting covered my head; but
it was open at the side to the square court, into which the horses, asses,
cows, and sheep were driven for the night.</p>
<p>After considerable delay, a rude supper was produced,&mdash;of which,
however, I could not persuade the family to partake till after
ourselves.&nbsp; They then ate up the remainder in company with my
servants.&nbsp; They were very solemn and slow in conversation; indeed, I
could not but suspect that they had some hostile schemes in preparation,
which they did not wish to have ascertained or communicated to their
neighbours.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Troubling myself very little about their local politics, I was
soon on my bed, and looking up at the brilliant stars.&nbsp; Sleep did not
come very soon, as the men kept up firing guns, and the women trilling
their songs, to a late hour.&nbsp; They said it was on account of a
wedding.</p>
<p>Daybreak found me up, and in full enjoyment of the exquisite luxury of
open air, in a clear and pure Oriental climate, before sunrise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p130.jpg">
<img alt="Remains of old Christian church" src="images/p130.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The servants were all busied in various occupations, and the peasantry
driving out the cattle, while I was surveying the considerable remains of
an old Christian church, which now forms one side of the shaikh&rsquo;s
mansion, and is used for a stable and a store of fodder.&nbsp; This
vignette represents its entrance, in a corner now darkened by the arcade in
which I had slept.&nbsp; The workmanship is massive and very rude, and the
Greek of the inscription upon the lintel not less barbarous, signifying
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;Martyr Memorial Church of the Holy
Herald,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, John the Baptist.</p>
<p>This discovery interested me deeply, in that region so remote from any
body of Christians at the present day, and among a population very like
savages dwelling amid stern hill-scenery.</p>
<p>Not less touching was the special designation of the saint so
commemorated.&nbsp; I believe that the Easterns pay more respect than
Europeans do to the memory of him whom the Saviour himself pronounced to be
greater than all the Old Testament prophets.&nbsp; And while we are
accustomed to ascribe to him only one of his official
characters,&mdash;that of the Baptizer,&mdash;they take pleasure in
recalling his other scriptural offices; as, for instance, this of the
<i>Herald</i>, or Preacher <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a> of righteousness, and that
of the <i>Forerunner</i>. <a name="citation131b"></a><a
href="#footnote131b" class="citation">[131b]</a>&nbsp; Indeed, individuals
are not unfrequently named after him in baptism by this latter appellation,
without the name John.</p>
<p>This building appears to have been at all times heavy and coarse in
construction; indeed, one may fairly suppose that part of the frontal has
at some time been taken down, and strangely put together again.</p>
<p>This church is the only object of curiosity that I had found along the
recent novel route.</p>
<p>On leaving <i>Mejdal</i>, I descended to inspect once more the site so
interesting to me of <i>Ras el &rsquo;Ain</i>, at half an hour&rsquo;s
distance,&mdash;which I unhesitatingly <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>believe to be
<i>Antipatris</i>, as I conceived it to be on my first seeing the place the
preceding year.&nbsp; I had then passed it rather late in the evening, and
upon the other side.</p>
<p><i>Cuf&rsquo;r Saba</i>, to which I was then going, is a wretched
village, of unburnt bricks, on the wide open plain, with no other water
near it than the deposit of rain-water in an adjoining square tank of
clay.&nbsp; Yet travelling authors have constantly pronounced this to be
the locality of Antipatris.&nbsp; Not one of them, however, has visited the
place.</p>
<p>What does Josephus say (Antiq. xvi. 5, 2, in
Whiston)?&mdash;&ldquo;After this solemnity and these festivals were over,
Herod erected another city in the plain called Caphar Saba, where he chose
out a fit place, both for plenty of water and goodness of soil, and proper
for the production of what was there planted; where a river encompassed the
city itself, and a grove of the best trees for magnitude was round
about.&nbsp; This he named Antipatris, from his father
Antipater.&rdquo;&nbsp; &Pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&nu;
&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&nu;
&alpha;&nu;&eta;y&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;&nu; &epsilon;&nu;

&tau;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&nu;
&epsilon;&upsilon;&upsilon;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&nu; . . .
&epsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&xi;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&kappa;.&tau;.&lambda;.&nbsp; No words can be more distinctly descriptive;
yet Robinson, who had not visited that district, in his positive manner
lays down that the village of Cuf&rsquo;r Saba is the site of Antipatris;
and &ldquo;doubtless&rdquo; all that is said about &ldquo;well
watered,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a river encompassing the city,&rdquo; means that
some wadi or watercourse came down from the hills in that <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>direction,
and made the place watery in the winter season.</p>
<p>Now, what are the facts remaining at the present day?&nbsp; Upon the
same plain with Cuf&rsquo;r Saba, and within sight of it, at hardly six
miles&rsquo; distance, is a large mound capable of containing a small town,
with foundations of ancient buildings, bits of marble, Roman bricks, and
tesser&aelig; scattered about,&mdash;but especially a large strong castle
of Saracenic work, the lower courses of the walls of real Roman
construction; and at the foot of the mound rises the river <i>Aujeh</i> out
of the earth in several copious streams, crowded with willows, tall wild
canes, and bulrushes,&mdash;the resort of numerous flocks, and of large
herds of horned cattle brought from a distance, and (as I have seen there)
counted by the Government inspector of the district, for the levying of
agricultural taxes upon them. <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; This is our Ras el
&rsquo;Ain.</p>
<p>For a considerable extent there is capital riding-ground of green grass,
so rare in Palestine.&nbsp; Let any one familiar with that country answer,
Could Herod have selected a better spot for a military station, (as
Antipatris was,) just on the border, descending from the hill-country upon
the plain?&nbsp; With this description in view, we understand all the more
vividly the narrative of Felix sending St Paul to C&aelig;sarea.&nbsp; To
elude the machinations of <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the conspiracy, the military party travelled
by night over the hilly region; and on reaching the castle of Antipatris,
the spearmen and other soldiers left him to continue the journey with
cavalry upon the plain to C&aelig;sarea, about three hours farther, (Acts
xxiii. 23, and 31, 32.)</p>
<p>It seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that this is the true site
of Antipatris; and as for Josephus calling that neighbourhood &ldquo;the
plain of Cuf&rsquo;r Saba,&rdquo; that must be for the same reason as
another part of the same vast extent was called the Plain of
Sharon,&mdash;or as it is now very much the custom for modern travellers to
call the whole Philistine plain by that name.</p>
<p>As for the statement that a river encompassed the city itself; I imagine
that the town was not upon the elevated mound,&mdash;this was probably
occupied by military works and a temple,&mdash;but upon the level of the
water, among the serpentine separate streams, which soon combine into one
river, the Aujeh, with its water-mills, and which was navigable for some
distance inland to the north of Jaffa.&nbsp; In the course of ages some of
these streams may have somewhat changed their direction.&nbsp; The mound
has still a dry trench around it, which must have anciently had its current
of water through it.</p>
<p>It cannot be that the deep trench dug by Alexander from Antipatris to
the sea (Antiq. xiii. 15, I, Whiston) can have begun at this village of
Cuf&rsquo;r Saba, where no water rises, and which is far away <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>from the
hills in an open plain.&nbsp; Although the words are distinctly,
&ldquo;from Capharzaba,&rdquo; the trench must have originated at the river
head, <i>i.e.</i>, Antipatris, where there was a fortified castle, and
passed round the nearest town, viz., that of Cuf&rsquo;r Saba.</p>
<p>I should observe, that not only Herod did well in selecting this spot
for a castle, because of its situation on the verge of the mountains,
commanding the road from Jerusalem to either C&aelig;sarea or Joppa; but
because it lies also upon the direct caravan track between Damascus and
Egypt, nearly at right angles with the other road.</p>
<p>The ruined Saracenic khan which now stands on the foundations of the
Roman castle, is of large size, and has a broken mosque in the centre of
the enclosure.</p>
<p>We rested and breakfasted, from our own resources, (without taxing the
Arab hospitality of Shaikh S&acirc;dek&rsquo;s family at Mejdal,) at the
springs of the Aujeh,&mdash;the water bubbling up warm from the ground,
among stones, with aquatic birds flying over us, and the morning breeze
sighing among the gigantic reeds and the willows.</p>
<p>We engaged a guide for what seemed likely to be a short day&rsquo;s
journey to <i>Ras Kerker</i>, the <i>cursi</i>, or metropolis, of another
dominant family&mdash;that of <i>Ibn Simhhan</i>&mdash;within the
mountains; but it proved far longer than was expected.</p>
<p>We were conducted due south, yet so far away from the line of hills that
we missed the Roman <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>temple of <i>M&rsquo;zeera&rsquo;a</i>, which
I do not know that, to this day, any European but myself has seen. <a
name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"
class="citation">[136]</a></p>
<p>To <i>Nebi Sari</i>, which is a pretty weli, two hour only from
Jaffa.&nbsp; To <i>Runtieh</i>, which is a poor place.&nbsp; Then
south-eastwards to <i>Teereh</i>; near which we started a gazelle across
the fields.</p>
<p>In that part of the country the population has so greatly increased of
late years that there was a scarcity of land for cultivation; and at the
end of autumn the villages contest the right of ploughing there by fights
of fire-arms.</p>
<p>Suddenly we turned into a valley, at an acute angle with our previous
road.&nbsp; This is named <i>Wadi el Kharnoob</i>&mdash;probably from some
conspicuous karoobah-tree.&nbsp; In ascending the hill, I looked back, and
had a beautiful prospect of Jaffa, and a white ship sailing on the sea.</p>
<p>We continued ascending higher and higher.&nbsp; Before us was a large
building on a single hill, which they called <i>Dair
Musha&rsquo;al</i>.&nbsp; Passed the ruined village,
<i>Hhanoonah</i>.&nbsp; On our right hand, among trees, was
<i>Desrah</i>.&nbsp; Passed through <i>Shukbeh</i>.&nbsp; How different is
the mountain air from that of the plain, so light and so pure!</p>
<p>Descended a little to <i>Shibtain</i>, where there was a great ancient
well; and being surrounded by hills, the place was very hot.&nbsp; Then for
some time over very dangerous paths, mounting upwards, till <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>we reached
the region of a cool breeze, such as I once heard a peasant say was
&ldquo;worth a thousand purses&rdquo; on a summer&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Saw <i>Ras Kerker</i>, the place of our destination, high above, in a
very remarkable situation; but how to get at it was a puzzle which patient
perseverance alone could solve.</p>
<p>We rode round and round one hill after another, till we reached <i>Dair
&rsquo;Amm&acirc;r</i>.&nbsp; Then opened upon us one of those few
prospects which in a lifetime impress themselves indelibly on the
mind.&nbsp; This was not lovely, but stern, consisting chiefly of a wild,
dark alternation of lower hills, with the valleys between them.</p>
<p>The villages hereabouts bear an appearance of prosperity&mdash;perhaps
because Turkish officials are never seen there; but the people of <i>Dair
&rsquo;Amm&acirc;r</i> behaved rudely.&nbsp; Down, deep deep down we went,
leading our horses, in order to rise afterwards to a higher
elevation.&nbsp; At length we reached a petty spring of water, where there
were some dirty, but otherwise good-looking women, who pointed out our path
towards the castle at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>The <i>Ibn Simhhan</i> people (being the great rivals of <i>Abu
Gosh</i>) had often invited me to visit them at this
castle,&mdash;describing with ardour the abundance and excellence of its
springs of water, and the salubrity of its atmosphere.</p>
<p>On arriving at the &ldquo;<i>Ras</i>,&rdquo; after a tedious and very
wearisome journey,&mdash;difficult as the place is of <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>access,&mdash;I found
it to fall far below those promises.&nbsp; There are no springs near
it.&nbsp; The only water is brought up by the women from the one which we
had passed far below.&nbsp; Only within the castle (which was begun while
building forty-four years before) some old wells, with good masonry stones,
were discovered.&nbsp; These are now put into good order, and kept full,
probably in readiness at any time against a siege by the faction of Abu
Gosh.&nbsp; Many battles and sieges take place in these remote places that
the Pasha of Jerusalem never hears of.</p>
<p>Although of modern origin, much of the earliest part of the castle is
already falling to decay&mdash;such as gates, steps, etc.&nbsp; It was a
melancholy spectacle to walk about the place, reminding one of some small
middle-aged castles that I have seen in Scotland, burnt or destroyed during
old times of civil warfare; or resembling my recollection, after many long
years, of Scott&rsquo;s description of the Baron Bradwardine&rsquo;s castle
in its later period.&nbsp; And the same melancholy associations recurred
yesterday at Mejdal Yaba.</p>
<p>The people assured us that the tortuous and rocky road that we had taken
from Ras el &rsquo;Ain was the best and nearest that we could have
taken.</p>
<p>We were received by a couple of relatives of Ibn Simhhan, who is now
Governor of Lydd; but they conducted us to the next village,
<i>J&acirc;niah</i>, to <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>be entertained there by the rest of the
family.&nbsp; On our descent to the village, we met our hosts coming to
meet us.</p>
<p><i>J&acirc;niah</i> is a poor place; and we had glimpses of curious
groups and scenes within the best one of the wretched houses.&nbsp; We were
received in a large room, to which the access was by a steep and broken set
of steps outside of the house.&nbsp; In the street below was a circle of
the elders of the village; and at the time of sunset, one of them mounted
on the corner of a garden wall to proclaim the <i>Ad&acirc;n</i>, or Moslem
call to prayers.&nbsp; I did not observe that he was at all attended
to.</p>
<p>A good number of the leading people came to visit us; and one old man
quoted and recited heaps of Arabic poetry for our entertainment while
awaiting the supper.</p>
<p>Then &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Lateef Ibn Simhhan, joined by another, (a
humbler adherent of the family,) gave us a vivid relation of the famous
battle of <i>Nezib</i> in 1838, and of his desertion from the Egyptian army
to the Turkish with a hundred of his mountaineers, well armed, during the
night; of how the Turkish Pasha refused to receive him or notice him till
he had washed himself in a golden basin, and anointed his beard from
vessels of gold; how the Turkish army was disgracefully routed; how he
(&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Lateef) was appointed to guard the Pasha&rsquo;s harem
during the flight, etc., etc.&nbsp; This narrative was occasionally
attested as true by a <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>negro slave in the room, who had been with my
host on that expedition.</p>
<p>The most lively fellow, however, of the party was one Hadj
&rsquo;Abdallah of Jerusalem, who has two wives, one a daughter of Ibn
Simhhan, the other a daughter of Abu Gosh!!&nbsp; His property in Jerusalem
consists chiefly of houses let out to Jews, whom he mimicked in their
Spanish and German dialects.</p>
<p>At length came supper; then sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Asaad Ibn Simhhan and Hadj
&rsquo;Abdallah rode with us to <i>Mezra&rsquo;ah</i> to show us some ruins
of an ancient city near it, called <i>Hharr&acirc;sheh</i>, where, as they
told us, there are &ldquo;figures of the children of men&rdquo; cut in the
rock.&nbsp; This roused our curiosity immensely, and I felt sure of success
in such company; for though we were in a very wild and unknown country, we
had the second greatest of the Ibn Simhhan family with us, and the Hadji
was evidently popular among them all.</p>
<p>We sent on our luggage before us to Jerusalem by <i>Bait Unah</i> and
<i>Bait Uksa</i>.</p>
<p>In rather less than an hour we reached <i>Mezra&rsquo;ah</i>&mdash;the
journey much enlivened by the drollery and songs of Hadj
&rsquo;Abdallah.&nbsp; Both he and Asaad had capital mares and ornamented
long guns.&nbsp; The latter was all dressed in white&mdash;the turban,
abbai, etc.&nbsp; His face was pale, and even his mare white.</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Arrived at the village, we all mounted to the roof of a
house&mdash;the people paying great reverence to Asaad.&nbsp; Gradually we
found the whole population surrounding us, and then closing nearer and
nearer upon us.&nbsp; As the heat of the sun increased, we descended to an
arcade of the same house, at the end of which there were some itinerant
Christians mending shoes for the people.</p>
<p>A breakfast was brought to us of eggs swimming in hot butter and honey,
with the usual Arab cakes of bread.&nbsp; The crowd could not be kept off;
and the people themselves told us it was because they had never before seen
Europeans.</p>
<p>One man asked for some gunpowder from my horn.&nbsp; I gave some to
Asaad, and one of the villagers took a pinch of it from him; then went to a
little distance, and another brought a piece of lighted charcoal to make it
explode on his hand.&nbsp; He came to me afterwards, to show with triumph
what good powder it must be, for it had left no mark on his skin.</p>
<p>Ibn Simhhan had to make the people move away their lighted pipes while I
was giving him some of the precious powder.&nbsp; He then informed the
assembly that I had come to see <i>Hharr&acirc;sheh</i> and the sculptured
figures.&nbsp; They refused to allow it.&nbsp; He insisted that I should
go; and after some violent altercation and swearing the majority of the men
ran to arm themselves and <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>accompany us, so as to prevent us from
carrying off the hidden treasures.</p>
<p>We rode away; and at every few hundred yards places were pointed out to
us as sites of clan massacres, or wonderful legends, or surprising escapes,
in deep glens or on high hills.&nbsp; At one time we passed between two
cairns of stones, one covering a certain &rsquo;Ali, the other a certain
Mohammed, both slain by ---.&nbsp; &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; The
Hadji gave no other reply than pointing over his shoulder to Asaad.&nbsp; I
felt as if transported a couple of centuries back to the wilds of
Perthshire or Argyleshire, among the Highland clans.&nbsp; The local
scenery was of a suitable character.</p>
<p>In about forty minutes we arrived at some lines of big stones, that must
have belonged to some town of enormous or incalculable antiquity; and this,
they told us, was <i>Hharr&acirc;sheh</i>.&nbsp; As for columns, the people
told us to stoop into a cavern; but there we could perceive nothing but a
piece of the rock remaining as a prop in the middle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, now
for the figures of the children of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people looked
furious, and screamed.&nbsp; They gathered round us with their guns; but
Asaad insisted; so a detachment of them led us down the side of a bare
rocky hill, upon a mere goat-path; and at last they halted before a rough,
uncut stone, whose only distinction from the many thousands lying about,
was that it stands upright.</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>Asaad observed our disappointment, and said something&mdash;I
forget the exact terms now&mdash;which led me to believe that this was not
the object he had meant, and that the ignorant, superstitious people could
not be coerced.&nbsp; He believed that this stone had been anciently set up
with some meaning&mdash;probably by some one who had buried treasures; not
as indicating the exact spot, but as leading in a line connected with some
other object, to the real place of concealment.</p>
<p>So here the matter ended; and, when the people saw us looking
disappointed, they went away satisfied to their village.</p>
<p>We parted from our friend Asaad Ibn Simhhan, taking one of the peasantry
with us to show us the way to Ram Allah, which he did through vineyards and
cheerful scenery; and we were soon again at that village after seventeen
days&rsquo; absence.&nbsp; In about two hours more we were in
Jerusalem.</p>

144</span>III.&nbsp; SOUTHWARDS ON THE PHILISTINE PLAIN AND ITS SEA
COAST.</h2>
<p>This extensive level is the original Palestine&mdash;the Pelesheth of
Exod. xv. 14, and Isa. xiv. 29.&nbsp; So named because it was the country
of the Pelishtim or Philistines (of Genesis x. 14, and <i>passim</i>) in
the Old Testament history, extending from about C&aelig;sarea to Gaza, or
farther southwards, and from the Mediterranean to the hill country of
Judea, west to east.</p>
<p>This district is so exclusively understood in modern times by the name
Palestine or Philistia, that a deputation of Oriental Christians coming
once on a friendly visit, inquired why upon my Arabic seal the English
consulate was designated that of &ldquo;Jerusalem and Palestine,&rdquo;
without mention of the other territories northwards to which its
jurisdiction extended, such as Galilee.&nbsp; I could only answer that the
ancient Romans called the whole country around, nay, even that beyond
Jordan, and as far as Petra, by the name of Palestine, and this fact was
old enough for us now-a-days to act upon.&nbsp; <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>&ldquo;Oh, the
Romans!&rdquo; they ejaculated, with a curious expression of countenance,
as if disappointed at the mention of such comparatively modern
people.&nbsp; So true is it that in the Holy Land, the Bible is the only
book of history for Christians, and scriptural incidents are the traditions
which leap over any number of centuries at a time.&nbsp; How little of this
state of mind existing among the inhabitants of that country is
comprehended in England!</p>
<p>But, in reference to the people Israel and the possession of it as the
promised land, this allotment, shared partly by each of the tribes of
Ephraim, Dan, and Judah, has a peculiar denomination&mdash;it is called the
Sheph&ecirc;lah, (translated by the common word <i>vale</i> in Josh. x. 40,
xi. 16, and elsewhere.)&nbsp; In Arabic authors also of Mohammedan period,
this large plain bears the same name, <i>Siphla</i>, meaning the same as in
Hebrew, the &ldquo;low country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, as one expanse from the hills to the sea, it bears one territorial
name, either Philistine or Hebraic, just as another region is called the
<i>Negeb</i>, or south, (see in the verses referred to above,) or as others
were designated the hill country, or the desert, or Ph&oelig;nicia.&nbsp;
And many a time have I stood on the summits of hills to the west of
Bethlehem, the eye ranging over its extent from the vicinity of Carmel to
Gaza, with Jaffa and Ekron in front, and have sometimes seen beyond this,
ships of large size sailing past on the &ldquo;great and wide sea&rdquo; of
the 104th Psalm.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>The ancient Philistines were not only exceptionally, but
generally, a large race of people, and the population there are to this day
remarkably tall; they are, even amid disadvantages, (that especially of
want of water,) much more cleanly in their persons and clothing than the
peasants of the hills, and many of their habits of life are modified by
their circumstances, such as the pressure of their wild Arab neighbours
from the southern desert that lies between them and Egypt.</p>
<p>Over this plain I have made several journeys at different periods, and
now proceed to put down my jottings of an excursion in the spring of
1849.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Sweet May-day&rdquo; in the Holy
Land as well as in England.</p>
<p>At Rachel&rsquo;s sepulchre, &ldquo;in the way to Ephrath, which is
Bethlehem,&rdquo; we parted from a company of friends who had ridden with
us from Jerusalem, and passed along the valley <i>Duhheish&rsquo;mah</i> to
the Pools of Solomon, then turned aside by the convent and village of <i>El
Khud&rsquo;r</i> (or St George), surrounded by flourishing vineyards.&nbsp;
Then mounting up a stony ridge, we came in view of the wide Philistine
plain, the hills falling in successive gradations from our feet to the
level of the plain, but separate objects could scarcely be distinguished on
account of the thick air of the prevailing Shirocco; green bushes, however,
and abundant wild flowers, <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>including the red everlasting,
pheasant&rsquo;s eye, cistus, and some late anemones, were about us; the
larks and the linnets were singing with delight.</p>
<p>In front was the village of <i>Hhus&acirc;n</i>, and two roads led
forward, that on the left to <i>Nahh&acirc;leen</i>, <i>Wad Fokeen</i>, and
<i>Jeba&rsquo;</i>; this was the road that I ought to have taken to <i>Bait
Nateef</i>, our place for the night, but being considerably ahead of our
baggage mules, I had ridden on with a kaww&acirc;s, under
<i>Hhus&acirc;n</i> and <i>Ras abu &rsquo;Amm&acirc;r</i>; by our wayside
lay a defaced Roman milestone.</p>
<p>A solitary peasant youth, from whom I inquired the names of the villages
about us, was so alarmed at the appearance of a European with a Turkish
attendant, in a place so remote from common high-roads, that he ran off;
but finding our horses keeping up with his fleet pace, he dropped behind a
large stone and levelled his gun at us in sheer terror; it was difficult to
get a rational reply from him.</p>
<p>Before us, a little to our left, was <i>Hhubeen</i>, half down a hill,
at the foot of which was a valley green with waving crops of wheat and
barley.</p>
<p>In ten minutes more there opened a fine view of <i>Bait
&rsquo;At&acirc;b</i>, in which were some good new buildings.&nbsp; Before
arriving at this village, which is the chief one of the
<i>&rsquo;Arkoob</i> district, ruled by <i>&rsquo;Othman el
Lehh&acirc;m</i>, I dismounted for rest beneath a gigantic oak, where there
were last year&rsquo;s acorns and their cups shed around, and half a dozen
saplings rising <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>from the ground, sheltered from the sun by
being all within the shadow of the parent tree; with arbutus bushes in
every direction, wild thyme and other fragrant herbs serving as pasture for
numerous humming bees, bright coloured bee-eaters were twittering in their
swallow-like flight, and under the soothing influence of the whole, I fell
into a pleasant slumber.</p>
<p>Some boughs of &ldquo;the huge oak&rdquo; were decorated with bits of
dirty rags hanging upon the boughs as votive memorials of answers to
prayers.&nbsp; Probably the site was that of a burial-place of some
personage of ancient and local celebrity; but my attendant was positive in
affirming that the people do not pray at such stations more than at any
other spot whatever.&nbsp; There are many such venerated trees in different
parts of the country.&nbsp; I believe that the reason as well as the amount
of such veneration is vague and unsettled in the minds of the peasantry,
yet the object remains a local monument from generation to generation,
honoured now, as were in the Bible times&mdash;the oak of Deborah (Gen.
xxxv. 8), the oak of Ophrah (Judges vi. II), for instance, with others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;Multosque per annos<br />
Multa vir&ucirc;m volvens durando s&aelig;cula vincit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By and by the groom overtook us on foot, having scoured about the
neighbourhood in search of us.&nbsp; After another half an hour&rsquo;s
rest, we followed him <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>across very rocky and slippery hills towards
the place of our destination&mdash;dwarf shrubs of evergreen oak,
honeysuckle, a spring of water, and an old well near the village of
Hhubeen, with doves cooing, and a vulture poised in the sky above.&nbsp;
Then a ruined village called <i>Lesed</i>, <a name="citation149"></a><a
href="#footnote149" class="citation">[149]</a> (as well as I could catch
the sound from a distance,) near which, among the shrubs, the gnats
troubled our horses exceedingly as evening drew on, which would imply the
neighbourhood of water.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Bait Nateef</i> just at sunset, but no luggage had as yet
arrived.&nbsp; This is <i>Netophah</i> in the lists of Ezra and
Nehemiah.</p>
<p>The chief and elders of the village were, according to custom of the
eventide, seated in a group, chattering or consulting, or calculating,
probably, about taxes, or respective shares of the common harvest, or the
alliances to be contracted for the next border-warfare, or marriages being
planned, or the dividing of inheritances, etc.&nbsp; My groom was admitted
into their circle, most likely welcomed as bringing the latest news from
Jerusalem, or as being able to describe this strange arrival, and the road
to be taken by us on the morrow.</p>
<p>I passed forward to select a spot for pitching the tents when they and
the food should arrive.&nbsp; The village shaikh of course tendered all the
hospitality in his power to offer, but this was <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>unnecessary beyond a
supply of water, milk, and eggs.</p>
<p>We waited, and waited: the sun was down; the stars came out, and the
moon shone over us; but at length the mule bells became audible, and our
dwellings and supplies came up.&nbsp; Supper and sleep are needless to
mention.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i> 2<i>d</i>.&mdash;The green hills around were enlivened
by the clucking of partridges among the bushes, and the olive-trees by the
cooing of doves.</p>
<p>Leaving this position with its extensive prospect, and passing an
enormous evergreen oak we crossed a noble valley, and soon reached the hill
on which stands <i>Sh&rsquo;weikeh</i>, (or <i>Shocoh</i> in Hebrew.)&nbsp;
This large valley runs east to west, and is the <i>Elah</i> of Scripture,
the scene of David&rsquo;s contest with Goliath&mdash;a wide and beautiful
plain, confined within two ranges of hills, and having a brook (dry at this
season) winding at half distance between them.&nbsp; The modern names for
the vale of &rsquo;Elah are <i>Musurr</i>, from the N.E. to near
Sh&rsquo;weikeh, and <i>Sunt</i> after that.</p>
<p>The plain was waving with heavy crops of wheat and barley, and the bed
of the stream, bordered by old trees of acacia, called Sunt, (in that
district called Hhar&acirc;z.)&nbsp; These are of a brilliant green in
summer, but as there are no such trees elsewhere nearer than Egypt, or the
Wadi &rsquo;Arabah, (for they require water,) the people relate a
traditional <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>account of their origin, and say that once upon a time the
country was invaded by a king of Egypt, named Abu Zaid, bringing a
prodigious army; but on the occurrence of a sudden alarm, they decamped in
such haste that their tent-pegs were left in the ground, which, being made
of Sunt wood, struck roots at the next rainy season, and sprung up as we
see them.&nbsp; Can this be a confused tradition of the rout of the
Philistines to Shaaraim on the fall of Goliath?</p>
<p>The vale or plain (for in Hebrew the word <i>Emek</i> is often applied
to the latter also when lying between ranges of hills&mdash;sometimes even
when they are of considerable breadth, as at Rephaim and elsewhere) is
about three hours or twelve miles long, and spacious enough to allow of
military occupation and action; hostile armies might of course also occupy
the opposite hills.&nbsp; From the direction of Hebron other valleys fall
into this wide plain.&nbsp; On another occasion I entered it by that called
<i>Wadi &rsquo;Arab</i> or <i>Shaikh</i>, descending from <i>&rsquo;Ain
Dirweh</i> and <i>Bezur</i> or <i>Bait Soor</i>.&nbsp; Wadi &rsquo;Arab is
commanded at its mouth by <i>Khar&acirc;s</i> on the north and <i>Nuba</i>
on the south.&nbsp; Near to the latter are the ruins of <i>&rsquo;Elah</i>,
which I have no doubt gave name to the valley, and not any remarkable
terebinth-tree, as is generally guessed by commentators on the Bible,
unless, indeed, some remarkable terebinth-tree at first gave name to the
village.&nbsp; Neither Robinson nor Porter appears to <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>have seen or heard of
this site of &rsquo;Elah, neither do they mention the route by the Wadi
&rsquo;Arab, which lies to the north of Wadi Soor, which they do
mention.</p>
<p>Southwards, but further inland, lies <i>Keelah</i>, which I suppose to
be the Keilah of 1 Sam. xxiii. I, the scene of a remarkable incident in
David&rsquo;s early career, before retiring to Ziph.&nbsp; The name is
registered four hundred years before that in Josh. xv. 44, among the cities
of Judah.</p>
<p>This, then, being the valley of &rsquo;Elah near to Shocoh, must have
been the scene of David and Goliath&rsquo;s encounter.&nbsp; How could the
Latin monks of the middle ages, and modern Roman Catholic travellers to
Jerusalem, ever believe that it took place at Kal&ocirc;neh near that
city?&nbsp; The perversion can only be attributed to their ignorance
concerning anything in the country beyond the immediate vicinity of their
convents.</p>
<p>We halted at the ruined village of Shocoh (now made by a grammatical
diminutive form of Arabic into Sh&rsquo;weikeh) after picking, each of us
his five smooth stones out of the brook, as memorials for ourselves, and
for friends far away, endeavouring at the same time to form a mental
picture of the scene that is so vividly narrated in sacred history, and
familiar to us from early childhood.</p>
<p>There are now no regular inhabitants at the place; only a few persons
occasionally live in caves and broken houses about there.&nbsp; Some
remnants <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>of antiquity, however, still exist, especially the wells, of fine
masonry and great depth, at the foot of the hill.&nbsp; This probably
represents the lower Shocoh mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome in the
Onomasticon, &ldquo;<i>Soccho</i>, duo sunt vici ascendentibus
Eleutheropoli &AElig;liam in nono milliario, alter superior, alter
inferior, qui vocantur Socchoth in tribu Jud&aelig;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
peasants wandering about brought me to the fallen lintel of the door of a
small mosque, bearing a rudely-executed Cufic-Arabic inscription, illegible
because, as they said, &ldquo;it had been eaten by the nights and
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Large flocks of sheep were pasturing over the stubble, (for some of the
harvest was already cut in that warm sheltered locality,) led by such
shepherd boys as David the Bethlehemite may have been, and large flights of
blue pigeons circling in short courses over our heads.&nbsp; Among the
demolished houses some women were churning the milk of the flocks in the
usual mode, by swinging alternately to each other a sewed up goat-skin,
(the bottle of the Old Testament, Josh. ix. 4; Judges iv. 19; Ps. cxix.
83;) a hill close at hand is crowned by a Mohammedan Weli (a kind of
solitary chapel) named <i>Salhhi</i>.</p>
<p>The view in every direction is most imposing.&nbsp; This rough plan will
give a tolerably good idea of the Vale of &rsquo;Elah.&nbsp; Across the
valley, opposite to Shocoh, stands a very fine terebinth-tree.&nbsp;
Possibly in ancient days there were many such in the <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>district, and so the
valley and the village of &rsquo;Elah may have acquired this name.</p>
<p><i>&rsquo;Ajoor</i> commands a view of the great plain and the
sea.&nbsp; From that hill, looking eastwards, the vale has a magnificent
appearance as a ground for man&oelig;uvres of an army.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p154.jpg">
<img alt="Plan of Vale of &rsquo;Elah" src="images/p154.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Near <i>Zacariah</i> the Wadi es Sunt contains but few of those
trees.&nbsp; We passed close under that prosperous-looking village with its
palm-tree, mounted a rocky path, and went along a valley &ldquo;covered
over with corn,&rdquo; (Ps. cxv. 13;) here the very paths were concealed by
the exuberant grain, so that we had to trample for ourselves a way through
it.</p>
<p>Emerging on the great plain, we had to wade monotonously through an
ocean of wheat.&nbsp; How <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>I longed to have with me some of the
blasphemers of the Holy Land, who tell us that it is now a blighted and
cursed land, and who quote Scripture amiss to show that this is a
fulfilment of prophecy. <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a></p>
<p>In many places, however, we saw how the rich produce had been trampled
down and rolled upon by camels, or by Bashi-bozuk soldiers on their
travels, after their horses were gorged to the full with gratuitous
feeding.&nbsp; We met a black slave of &rsquo;Othman el Lehh&acirc;m of
Bait &rsquo;At&acirc;b, a fine fellow, well mounted and armed, and he told
us that a large part of this wheat was his master&rsquo;s property.&nbsp;
He had been travelling from village to village upon business.&nbsp; His
noble bearing, and his being thus confidentially employed, reminded me of
the Arabic proverb, that &ldquo;Even a Shaikh&rsquo;s slave is a
Shaikh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one place I remarked some hundred yards square of fine oats.&nbsp;
This was surprising, as I knew that oats are not cultivated in
Palestine.&nbsp; The people assured me that they were of wild growth, but
they were of excellent quality; and as the name (Khafeer) seemed to be well
known, it seems difficult to understand that oats have not been at some
time cultivated in that part of the country.&nbsp; With respect to its
Arabic name, it is worth notice <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>how near it is to the German name (Hafer) for
oats.&nbsp; Wetzstein has since found wild oats growing on the N.E. of the
Haur&acirc;n.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>&rsquo;Ain Shems</i>, the Beth Shemesh of the Bible, (I
Sam. vi. 9, <i>passim</i>,) where, instead of the large population of
ancient times, we found nothing but a weli and some fragments of peasant
houses.</p>
<p>Due north from us as we rested, lay on the summit of a hill,
<i>Sora&rsquo;&acirc;</i>, which is Zorah, the birthplace of Samson, where
the angel appeared to Manoah and his wife.&nbsp; The people told us of
<i>Amoor&icirc;ah</i> to the left, but we could not quite see it, and the
same with respect to <i>Tibneh</i>, or <i>Dibneh</i>, the Timnath of
Samson&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>All the plain and the low hills formed one waving sheet of corn, without
divisions or trees; and often, as we had no tracks for guidance, we had to
take sight of some object on the horizon, and work straight forward towards
it.&nbsp; It was amid such a wonderful profusion that Samson let loose the
foxes or jackals with firebrands, taking revenge on the Philistines, and he
called it &ldquo;doing them a displeasure!&rdquo;&nbsp; I have seen from
Jerusalem the smoke of corn burning, which had accidentally taken fire in
that very district.</p>
<p>On the summit of a hill, where were good square stones of old masonry, I
got into a sheepfold of stone walls, looking for antiquities; but, alas!
came out with my light-coloured clothes <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>covered with fleas;
fortunately the clothes were not woollen.</p>
<p>Further on we had <i>Bait Ziz</i>, or <i>Jiz</i>, on the right, with
<i>Dej&acirc;jeh</i>, or <i>Edj&acirc;jeh</i>, and <i>Na&rsquo;ana</i>, or
<i>Ra&rsquo;ana</i>, on the left; <i>Khulda</i> in the distance at N.W.; a
vast expanse of growing grain in every direction.</p>
<p>The population hereabouts are a fine race for stature, and paler in
complexion than our peasantry on the hills; and it ought to be the reverse,
unless, as is certainly the case, they are a distinct people.</p>
<p>We traversed the plain to <i>&rsquo;Akir</i>, which is Ekron of
Scripture, one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, and chief
place of the worship of Baal-zebub, (2 Kings i. 3.)&nbsp; All our inquiries
had been in vain for any name that could possibly have been Gath.&nbsp; The
utter extinction of that city is remarkable&mdash;the very name
disappearing from the Bible after Micah, B.C. 730.&nbsp; Amos, B.C. 787,
and Zephaniah, B.C. 630, mention the four other cities of the Philistines,
omitting Gath.&nbsp; The name never occurs in the Apocrypha or the New
Testament.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Akir is now a very miserable village of unburnt brick; indeed,
all the villages of this district are of that material, owing to the
extreme rarity of stone.&nbsp; We saw women cutting bricks out of the
viscous alluvial soil, and boys swimming luxuriously in the pool of rain
water settled during winter in the <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>excavation for
bricks&mdash;quarry we might style it, if the material were stone.&nbsp;
There was plenty of ploughing in progress for the summer crops of sesame,
durrah, etc., and the people seemed rich in horned cattle.</p>
<p>This last feature constitutes another difference between them and the
hill country.&nbsp; In the mountains, where the Bedaween forays are almost
unknown, the cattle bred are principally sheep and goats.&nbsp; On the
plains, flocks of sheep might be easily swept off by those marauders, oxen
not so easily; the people, therefore, principally breed this species of
cattle, and instead of idle shepherd boys amusing themselves with little
flutes, and guiding the sheep by throwing stones at them, the herds here
are driven by mounted horsemen with long poles.&nbsp; The flatness of the
country and the frequency of oxen will serve to illustrate the exactness of
Bible narratives, particularly in the matter of the wheeled carriage and
the kine used for conveying the ark of God from this place, Ekron, to
Bethshemesh (I Sam. vi.)</p>
<p>Forward we went to <i>Yabneh</i>, (Jabneel of Josh. xv. II, and Jabneh
of 2 Chron. xxvi. 6,) where it is mentioned in connexion with Gath and
Ashkelon.&nbsp; It was a border city of Judah, where the <i>Wadi
Sur&acirc;r</i>, (called here the river <i>Rubin</i>,) forms the boundary
between Judah and Dan.&nbsp; I think we may identify it as the
&ldquo;Me-Jarkon and the border that is over against Japho,&rdquo; of Josh.
xix. 46.&nbsp; It is the <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Jamnia, where, for a long time after the Roman
overthrow of Jerusalem, was a celebrated college of the Talmudists, before,
however, the traditions and speculations of the rabbis were collected into
volumes of Mishna and Gemara.&nbsp; It is believed that the truly great and
venerable Gamaliel is buried here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p159.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient church, now mosque, Yabneh" src="images/p159.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Yabneh stands on a rising ground, and although a village of sun-baked
bricks, it has remains of a Christian church, now used as a mosque, with a
tower of stone.</p>
<p>While resting under a tree, awaiting the coming up of our baggage,
&rsquo;Abd&rsquo;errahhm&acirc;n Bek el &rsquo;Asali, a companion of ours
from Jerusalem, threw a stone at a young filly and cursed her, because the
colours of her legs were of unlucky omen.&nbsp; On such matters the native
Moslems entertain strong prejudices, which are based upon precise and
well-known rules.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>On the arrival of our mules, we pitched the tents upon a pretty
green common with a row of trees; the verdure consisted of wild clover, and
leaves remaining of wild flowers&mdash;chiefly of the wild pink.&nbsp; It
is an Arab proverb that &ldquo;Green is a portion of paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The villages in sight were <i>Besheet</i> to the S.E., and <i>El
Kubeibeh</i> to the N.E.&nbsp; Our day&rsquo;s journey from Bait Nateef had
been one of only seven hours, viz., from 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
to 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>
<p>The population seemed very industrious: they have cheerful
<i>bay&acirc;rahs</i>, or enclosed orchards, and the open fields were
exceedingly well cultivated.&nbsp; The evening scene was most pleasing,
comprising the return of flocks and herds from pasture, and the
barley-harvest coming home upon asses and camels with bells on their
necks&mdash;all enlivened by the singing or chattering of women and
children.</p>
<p>As the day advanced I was happily employed at my tent door reading the
Arabic New Testament; it should have been in Hebrew at Yamnia, as being
more profitable than all the Pirk&eacute; Avoth of the Talmud.&nbsp; At
sunset our party walked out in the fields to shoot the pretty
bee-eaters.</p>
<p>Of this village there is a tale current among the peasantry over the
country, which conveys an important lesson for the conduct of human
life.</p>
<p>An old Shaikh of Yabneh had five sons.&nbsp; When <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>very old, a complaint
was brought to him that some one had stolen a cock; so he called together
his sons and ordered them all to search for the cock; but it was not
found.&nbsp; Some time afterwards it was represented to him that a sheep
was stolen; he then commanded his sons to go and search for the cock.&nbsp;
They replied, &ldquo;O our father, it is not a cock but a sheep that is
stolen;&rdquo; but he persisted in his command, and they did what they well
could, but without success.&nbsp; After that he was told that a cow was
missing; he again commanded his sons to look after the cock.&nbsp; They
thinking he had lost his senses, cried, &ldquo;<i>Sallem &rsquo;akalak ya
Abuna</i>, (May God perfect thy understanding, O our father,) it is not a
cock but a cow that is missing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go look for the
cock,&rdquo; persevered the old man; they obeyed, but this time again
without success.&nbsp; People wondered and thought him in a state of mere
dotage.&nbsp; Next came the news that a man was killed.&nbsp; The father
pertinaciously adhered to his first injunctions, and ordered his sons to
look for the cock.&nbsp; Again they returned without finding it, and in the
end it came to pass that the killing of the man brought on a blood feud
with his relations&mdash;the factions of several villages took up the case
for revenge, and the whole town was destroyed, and lay long in a state of
desolation, for want of sufficient zeal in discovering and punishing the
first offence, the stealing of the cock, which thus became a root of all
the rest.&nbsp; There is <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>a good deal of wisdom contained in this
narrative or allegory, whichever it may be considered.&nbsp; Offenders
become emboldened by impunity, and the first beginnings should be
checked.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i> 3<i>d</i>.&mdash;Early dew around the tents upon the
green.&nbsp; We mounted at half-past six.&nbsp; I rode up to the village
and got to the top of the tower in the village.</p>
<p>After an hour and a half of level riding southwards, we arrived at a
broad old sycamore in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Another hour brought us to <i>Asdood</i> (<i>Ashdod</i>) of the
Philistines, with <i>Atna</i> and <i>Bait Dur&acirc;s</i> on our
left.&nbsp; I do not know where in all the Holy Land I have seen such
excellent agriculture of grain, olive-trees, and orchards of fruit, as here
at Ashdod.&nbsp; The fields would do credit to English farming&mdash;the
tall, healthy, and cleanly population wore perfectly white though coarse
dresses, and carried no guns, only the short sword called the
Khanjar.&nbsp; We rested in an orchard beneath a large mulberry-tree, the
fruit of which was just setting, and the adjacent pomegranate-trees shone
in their glazed foliage and bright scarlet blossoms, the hedges of prickly
pear were bursting into yellow fruit, palm-trees rising beyond, the sky was
of deep sapphire brilliancy, and the sun delightfully hot.</p>
<p>Here then had been the principal temple of the fish-god Dagon, which
fell nightly in presence of <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>the Israelitish ark.&nbsp; Not the only
temple, however, for there is still a village near Jaffa with the name of
<i>Bait Dajan</i>, and another still further north, in the same plain, but
in the Nabloos district.&nbsp; Strange that this temple of Dagon at Ashdod
should have survived and preserved its worship so late as nearly to the
Christian era, when it was burnt by Jonathan the Jerusalem high priest,
(Josephus Ant., xiii. 4, 4; Macc. x. 84.)</p>
<p>Ought not Gath to be sought between this, and Ekron, according to 1 Sam.
v.?&nbsp; See also 2 Chron. xxvi. 6.</p>
<p>Soon after remounting we arrived at the ruin of a fine old <i>Khan</i>,
one of the numerous establishments of the kind upon the camel road from
Damascus to Egypt, but now every one of them is broken and unfit for
use.&nbsp; There was a noble column of granite lying across the gateway,
and two Welies close adjoining.</p>
<p>Reached <i>Hham&acirc;meh</i> at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
from which we turned aside through lanes of gardens, and over deep sand
towards <i>&rsquo;Ascalon</i>, leaving <i>Mejdal</i> on our left, with its
lofty tower rising over an extensive plantation of olive-trees.&nbsp; This
tower is believed to be of Moslem erection.&nbsp; Passing another village
on our left, we at length came to <i>Jurah</i>, a wretched brick hamlet,
stuck as it were against the ancient walls of &rsquo;Ascalon.</p>
<p>We were on the sea-beach at noon.&nbsp; Upon this beach lie stupendous
masses of overthrown <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>city wall, and numerous columns of blue-gray
granite of no very imposing dimensions.&nbsp; A great number of these have
been at some time built horizontally into those walls, from which their
ends protrude like muzzles of cannon from a modern fortification.&nbsp;
This arrangement, with the same effect, is also found at Tyre,
C&aelig;sarea, and other places along the coast.</p>
<p>The site or lie of the city is principally in two hollow basins, in
which the detrition of houses forms now a soil for grain, for fruit gardens
and good tobacco.</p>
<p>We were shown the ruins of what the people call &ldquo;the
Church,&rdquo; where there are several very large columns of polished
granite lying prostrate, but neither there nor elsewhere could any capitals
be found belonging to the columns.&nbsp; All over the East such objects are
appropriated by townspeople as ornaments inside the houses, especially at
the mouths of wells.</p>
<p>The people pointed out to us from a distance the spot where H. E. Zareef
Pasha had lately obtained the marble slab of bas-relief, which he sent to
the museum at Constantinople.</p>
<p>The walls of &rsquo;Ascal&acirc;n are clearly distinguishable in all
their circuit, and have been of great thickness.</p>
<p>The position of this &ldquo;Bride of Syria,&rdquo; as the Saracens
designated it, is very fine, and the prospect around must have been
beautiful; but of <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>this prize of so many sieges and neighbouring
battles, the joy of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, where he laboured with his
own hands in repairing the broken walls, only its name with the scriptural
and later romantic history remain to claim our attention, and verify the
prediction of the prophet Zephaniah, ii. 4-6.</p>
<p>I found no coins there, and none were brought to me; only some were
brought to me in an after-journey at Mejdal; I therefore pass by for this
time the classical allusions to the fish goddess, Deceto.&nbsp; A beautiful
head of a female statue, but blackened by fire, brought from Ascalon, has
since been sold to me, which I delivered to our museum.</p>
<p>We remained there an hour, then rode to <i>Naaleea</i>.&nbsp; The fine
plain over which we galloped must have had many an English rider upon it in
the Crusading times&mdash;many a man who never saw &ldquo;merrie
England&rdquo; again, even in company with King Richard.</p>
<p><i>Naaleea</i>, though built of brick, bears an appearance of real
cleanliness; the olive plantation from Mejdal reaches thus far.</p>
<p>The barley reaped at <i>Berberah</i> was, I believe, the finest I have
ever seen; and there were pretty roads winding among olive groves, orchards
well enclosed by prickly-pear hedges, with bee-eaters skimming and
twittering before us.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span><i>Bait Jirja</i> on the left; then after a good while <i>Bait
Hh&acirc;noon</i> also on the left.</p>
<p>Reached <i>Ghuzzeh</i> (Gaza) at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp;
The very remarkable approach is by an avenue of at least a mile long, very
wide like a boulevard, through an immense park of olive grounds, with the
city for an object of vista at the end.</p>
<p>We encamped on the further side of Gaza, having the old reservoir called
<i>Birket el Bash&acirc;</i> between us and the Lazaretto.</p>
<p>Cheerful scene of camels and asses bearing the barley-harvest home,
attended by women and children; small flocks of sheep also, with their
shepherd lads playing sweet and irregular airs on their <i>nayahs</i>.</p>
<p><i>Friday</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;I resolved to stay here over Sunday.</p>
<p>The morning was cool, and though our situation was entirely unsheltered,
I judged even the risk of exposure to the noontide sun, when it should
arrive, not to be refused, while it gave us the blessings of free air from
the sea and delivery from mosquitoes, which would certainly have plagued us
under the shade of the fruit-trees.&nbsp; There was a mean suburb in front
of our position, tenanted solely by Egyptians.</p>
<p>The sound of the distant sea rolling on the beach (though this was out
of sight,) was music to my ears.&nbsp; Near us was a fence of the
prickly-pear, (named <i>Saber</i>, or &ldquo;patience&rdquo; in
Arabic.)&nbsp; One of <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>our party referred to its extraordinary degree
of vitality, even under disadvantageous circumstances.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the &rsquo;Asali, &ldquo;she has drunk of the
water of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to visit the Lazaretto, and while conversing with the doctor (M.
Esp&eacute;ron,) and the Turkish superintendent, four wild Arabs were
brought in, their hands fettered and chains on their legs, accused of
striking a soldier near <i>Khan Yunas</i>.&nbsp; When identified by
witnesses merely uttering two or three words, they were removed, cruelly
pushed about in their chains and beaten on the head by the soldiers, who
enjoyed the cowardly fun which they would not dare to perpetrate had the
fine tall fellows had their limbs at liberty.</p>
<p>The captain of the Bashi-bozuk, having called at my tents with his
mounted troop, followed me to the Lazaretto.</p>
<p>Returning home, and after some rest, or rather a visit from some Greek
Christians which gave me no rest, I went to visit the newly-arrived
kaimakam, or governor, one of the celebrated &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Hadi
family of Nabloos.&nbsp; His divan room was crowded with visitors of
congratulation: such as shaikhs of villages, and some dignified Arab
chiefs; the latter interceding on behalf of the men recently captured by
the quarantine people; the former soliciting their official investitures
for their several districts.&nbsp; The house was exceedingly mean and <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>shattered, but this medley of visitors formed an interesting
subject of study.</p>
<p>I next visited the k&acirc;di, (judge,) who was holding his court in the
open air, with a canvas screen to shelter his head from the sun, in the
midst of orchards and a flower garden.&nbsp; A cause, in which some women
were vociferating and screeching in Arabic, (to which that language lends
peculiar facility,) was suspended in order to receive my visit, and the
litigants had to remain in silence at some distance till I left, returning
to the tents.</p>
<p>All the people here praise the air and water of Gaza, and declare that
disease of any kind is nearly unknown, except ophthalmia, which, of course,
can be generally prevented.&nbsp; Provisions are said to be cheap; but the
bread, as sold in the market, not so good as in Jerusalem or Nabloos.&nbsp;
Probably their excellent wheat is exported to a distance.</p>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rode southwards on a day&rsquo;s
excursion to Khan Yunas, with my people and an escort of two of the
quarantine Bashi-bozuk.&nbsp; One of these, named Hadji Ghaneem, was a
hardy old fellow, encircled by pistols and swords; his old gun, that was
slung at his back, had the rusty bayonet fixed, perhaps fixed by the
rust.&nbsp; The other, Hadji Khaleel, was an amusing companion, with plenty
to tell and fond of talking.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Started before 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, passing between
cornfields, with numerous larks trilling in the air.</p>
<p>At some distance we came to a low hill lying on our right hand, all the
ground about being mere sea sand drifted inland.&nbsp; This is called
<i>Tell-ul-&rsquo;Ejel</i>, &ldquo;the Calf&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; so named
from its being haunted by the ghost of a calf, which no one has yet laid
hold of, but whenever this shall be accomplished the fortunate person will
come into possession of the boundless treasures concealed within the
hill.&nbsp; Some say that this good luck will happen to any one that is
favoured with a dream of the calf three times in succession.&nbsp; All our
party professed to believe the local tradition, especially one who had been
in Europe, and from whom such credulity had been less expected; but he was
sure that some tales of that nature are well founded, and if so, why not
this?&nbsp; In my opinion, it is probably a superstition connected with
some ancient form of idolatry.</p>
<p>Half-way along our journey we came to a village called <i>Ed Dair</i>,
(the convent, perhaps the <i>Dair el Belahh</i> of the list;) but this
appellation Dair is often given to any large old edifice of which the
origin is unknown.&nbsp; Here was a loop-holed Moslem tower occupied by
twenty men of the Bashi-bozuk.&nbsp; Such towers are called <i>Shuneh</i>
in the singular, <i>Shu&acirc;n</i> in the plural.</p>
<p><i>Khan Yunas</i> is a hamlet of unburnt bricks, dirty and ruinous,
which is not always the case with <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>other villages of
that material; the reason of this being so, I suppose to be, that most of
its few houses are inhabited by Turkish soldiers.&nbsp; This is the last
station southwards held by the sultan&rsquo;s forces, the next, <i>El
Areesh</i>, being an Egyptian outpost.&nbsp; I was desirous of visiting
that place had time allowed, not only for the satisfaction of curiosity on
the above account, but in order to get some idea from ocular inspection
whether the little winter stream or Wadi there could ever have been the
divinely-appointed boundary of the land promised to Abraham and his seed
for ever.&nbsp; My prepossession is certainly to the contrary.</p>
<p>However, I rode ten minutes beyond Khan Yunas, and sat to rest in a
field beneath a fig-tree; the day was hot and brilliant, but there was a
fine breeze coming in from the sea.&nbsp; The scene was picturesque enough,
for there was a mosque-minaret and a broken tower rising behind a thick
grove of palm-trees and orchards of fig, vine and pomegranate&mdash;a high
bank of yellow sand behind the houses of the village, and the dark blue
Mediterranean behind that.</p>
<p>With respect to the name of the place, there are many such in the
country, and it is a mistake to ridicule the Moslems for believing in all
of them as true sites of the large fish vomiting out Jonah, which they do
not.&nbsp; These are, I believe, merely commemorative stations, and we are
not in the habit of ridiculing Christians for having several <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>churches
under the same appellation; also it is not quite certain that all the
Welies named after Yunas (Jonas) or Moosa (Moses) do refer to the Old
Testament prophets.&nbsp; There have been Mohammedan reputed saints bearing
those names.</p>
<p>Near this place is a village called <i>Beni Seheela</i>.&nbsp; On the
return we left behind us the old Hadji Ghaneem, with his brown bayonet, and
took a nearer road to Gaza, not so close to the sea as that by which we had
left it.&nbsp; It was an easy pleasant ride, and there were barley crops
almost all the way.&nbsp; We reached the tents in three hours from Khan
Yunas.</p>
<p>At sunset, which is the universal dinner time in the east, I went to
dine with the Governor Mohammed &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Hadi; it was a
miserable degrading scene of gorging the pilaff with the hands and
squeezing the butter of it through the fingers, without even water for
drink supplied by the servants.&nbsp; The guests were about a dozen in
number, and they were crowded so closely round the tinned tray as only to
admit of their right arms being thrust between their neighbours, in order
to do which the sleeves had to be tucked back; there was but little
conversation beyond that of the host encouraging the guests to eat
more.</p>
<p>Previous to eating, the governor and his younger brother performed their
prayers in brief, after experiencing some difficulty in finding the true
Kebleh direction for prayer, the rest of the company <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>gossiping around them
all the time.&nbsp; Above our heads was suspended a rude copper lamp, and
the terrace just outside the door was occupied by slaves and other
attendants; boughs of adjoining palms and other trees were softly stirred
by an evening breeze, and the imperial moon shone over all.</p>
<p>After washing of hands and a short repose, (the other guests smoking of
course their chibooks and narghilehs, and chatting upon topics of local
interest,) I asked leave, according to Oriental etiquette, to take my
departure.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Read the eighth chapter of Acts in
Arabic, and some of our English liturgy in that noble language, with one of
my companions.&nbsp; I feel certain, concerning the dispute whether the
word &epsilon;&rho;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; (desert) in the twenty-sixth
verse of the above chapter, refers to the city or to the road, that the
true sense of the passage is this, &ldquo;Go toward the south unto the way
that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the way
which is desert or free from towns and villages&mdash;as in Matt. iii. 1,
and other places where the word in question does not imply the common
European idea of any desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a Sabbath stillness during most of the day, the people having
been instructed that English Christians observe the Lord&rsquo;s-day with
more serious composure than it is the habit of native Christians to do.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>In the afternoon, however, the governor came on a visit with a
long train of attendants mounted on beautiful horses, for which, indeed,
this district is famed&mdash;there were specimens of M&acirc;naki, Jilfi,
K&rsquo;baish&acirc;n, Mukhlad&icirc;yeh, etc., etc.&nbsp; Mohammed, of
course, discoursed as well as he could on European politics, and stayed
long.</p>
<p>After his departure I strolled to look at some short columns of marble
standing on a slight swell of ground; they are now inscribed to the memory
of certain Moslem martyrs in battle of our fourteenth century, <i>i.e.</i>,
about seven centuries after the Hej&rsquo;ra.&nbsp; These columns look very
much as if they had been taken from some old Christian church, then each
sawn into halves, and each of the halves partly sliced on one side to
receive the inscription.</p>
<p>After sunset I dined with old Ibrahim Jahhsh&acirc;n, and his numerous
household, (the principal one of the Christian families,) and a troop of
friends.&nbsp; It was not a better entertainment than that of the kaimakam
yesterday; perhaps, it would not be desirable for him to surpass the
constituted authority of the city in such matters.</p>
<p>Among the company was the N&acirc;zir el Auk&acirc;f, (the
superintendent of mosque-endowment property,) also a Durweesh from Lahore,
consequently a British subject,&mdash;he was full of fun, and wanted me to
make him a present of some fulminating balls and crackers; he assured me
that in the Hharam (sanctuary, commonly called the Mosque <!-- page
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>of Omar,) at
Jerusalem, there were at least thirty such British subjects as himself
residing, including his own brother.&nbsp; A Turkish soldier present drank
wine, as soon as the commissioner for inquiring into the delinquencies of
the late governor had turned his back upon the table.</p>
<p>Before dinner I had accompanied the family to the church, (Greek rite,)
where the priest was waiting to receive me.&nbsp; It was a poverty-stricken
edifice, purposely kept so, in order to obviate the envy and malice of the
Mohammedans; and all the Christians that I saw in Gaza were a
stupid-looking people; they are few in number, and grievously oppressed by
their numerous Moslem fellow-townsmen, being far away from the notice of
consuls.&nbsp; One cannot but regard with compassion a people who have for
ages endured suffering for the name of Christ, while facilities are offered
for acquiring wealth and honour by apostasy.&nbsp; Generation after
generation remains still as firm in their Christian creed as those before
them, and now perhaps more so than ever.</p>
<p>I was surprised to learn that it is only about two generations since the
Samaritans ceased to be a sect in Gaza, with their place of
worship&mdash;they are now found nowhere but in Nabloos.</p>
<p>There is a slave-traffic in Gaza; but it only consists in the
consignment of articles already commissioned for in Egypt, on behalf of
private purchasers in Syria&mdash;at least, so the world is given <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>to
understand.&nbsp; The boundary of the two countries is so near that the
Arabic dialect spoken here nearly approaches the Egyptian.</p>
<p>I made some inquiries as to the popular ideas on the achievements of
Samson at Gaza, but only obtained such uncertain and even contradictory
answers, that on this journey it did not seem worth while to take any great
trouble on the subject; but I certainly had not expected to get better
information from either the Mohammedans or from the poor ignorant
Christians there.</p>
<p>The night was most beautiful, with full moonlight streaming, and stars
peering between the swaying fronds of the lofty palm-trees, which grow more
luxuriantly in Gaza then I had seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>The muleteers singing around their watch-fire.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Tents struck and march commenced at 7
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&nbsp; We returned through the great avenue
by which we had arrived, but soon diverged upon the road to Hebron.</p>
<p>Alongside of <i>Bait Hhanoon</i> by half-past eight, where there was
abundance of bee-eaters, and these imply fruit-trees.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Abd&rsquo;errahhm&acirc;n tried to shoot some, but failed, having no
small shot, but only bullets for his gun.</p>
<p>At nine we left <i>Timrah</i> a little on our left.&nbsp; The people
everywhere busied in reaping barley&mdash;a very lively scene; the reapers,
as usual all over Palestine, wearing large leather aprons exactly <!-- page
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>like those
used by blacksmiths in England, only unblackened by the forge; the women
had face veils of the Egyptian pattern.&nbsp; Cows, goats, and sheep were
feeding at liberty in the fields upon the new stubble.</p>
<p>In thirty-five minutes more we arrived at <i>Semsem</i>, leaving <i>Bait
Nejed</i> on the right.</p>
<p>At five minutes past ten we reached <i>B&rsquo;rair</i>, near which we
rested for an hour, the day being very sultry, under an old tamarisk-tree,
which on the plains instead of <i>Turfa</i> is called <i>Itil</i>.</p>
<p>An intelligent old man named &rsquo;Ali came up to me from the reaping
and conversed much on the sad condition of agricultural affairs,
complaining of the cruel oppression suffered by the peasantry from their
petty local tyrants, and entreated me if I had any means of letting the
Sultan of Constantinople know of it, that I would do so.&nbsp; He
particularly described the exactions they had to endure from Muslehh el
&rsquo;Az&rsquo;zi of Bait Jibreen, and all his family.</p>
<p>Thence passing over an extensive plain, we had in sight for a long time
a distant Dair (so-called convent) and village of <i>Kar&acirc;teen</i>,
also at one time a village called <i>Hhata</i>.</p>
<p>At twenty minutes to one we reached <i>Falooja</i>; the heat had become
intense, and incessant swarms of black stinging flies annoyed our horses
beyond patience.&nbsp; In fact the Philistine plain (which, however, we
were now soon to leave) was always noted <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>for the plague of
flies, and this gave rise to the ancient deprecatory worship of Baal-zebub,
&ldquo;the lord of flies,&rdquo; by that people; there is still a village
upon the plain named <i>Dair ed Dub&acirc;n</i>, &ldquo;the convent (or
temple) of flies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later in the summer this plague is said to
be so intolerable to horses and animals of burden that travelling is only
attempted there by night-time.</p>
<p>At length came a rustling noise along the fields and rain fell slowly in
drops large as good teaspoonfuls, yet the heat was so great that my coat of
nearly white linen did not for some time show marks of wetness; a black
cloud from which the water fell accompanied us along the line of route, and
the rain from it increased.</p>
<p>Over the plain going eastwards we had for a long time in view a rocky
hill with a Weli crowning its summit; on our right, <i>i.e.</i> southwards,
a conspicuous object, and called <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;k Munsh&icirc;yah</i>
(the rock of Munsh&icirc;yah.)&nbsp; This is not to be confounded with the
similar cliff cropping out of the plain, but upon our left, and called
<i>Tell es S&acirc;fieh</i>.</p>
<p>We noticed several deserted villages with small breastworks and turrets
of loose construction remaining where the peasantry had of late resisted
the raids of the southern Bedaween, but unsuccessfully.&nbsp; We were told
by a solitary foot-passenger of such incursions having taken place only a
day or two before, whereupon our muleteers took fright and hurried on
apace.&nbsp; We all examined the state <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>of our firearms,
while the storm was driving furiously in our faces.</p>
<p>The rain was over as we reached <i>Bait Jibreen</i>, just after 3 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; This important place was our station for
the day.&nbsp; We pitched in an eligible situation under a line of
olive-trees at some distance from the houses, in view of the principal
antique buildings.&nbsp; The principal people came out to welcome us,
especially &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez, the brother of the N&acirc;zir
Shaikh Muslehh, for whom I had brought a letter of recommendation from the
governor of Gaza.</p>
<p>We were fatigued as much as anything from the effect of the shirocco
wind.&nbsp; Then dark clouds from a distance with thunder surrounded
us.&nbsp; As the time of sunset approached, the preparations for dinner
were interrupted by the driving of a heavy shirocco, low, near the ground,
which soon became so strong that the tents began to tumble over, and we
took refuge in the house of &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez; there was,
however, no rain.</p>
<p>Here then I was lodged in a house of sun-baked bricks plastered inside
with mud, but as clean as such a house could possibly be.&nbsp; There were
cupboard recesses in the walls, a fireplace and chimney, wooden nails
driven into &ldquo;sure places&rdquo; in the walls, (see Isa. xxii. 23,)
strange scratches of blue and red painting in fancy scrolls, etc.; a raised
Mastabah or dais, and a lower part of course near the door, for guests to
leave their shoes there; the <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>whole being roofed by a few strong beams
wattled between with faggot-wood.&nbsp; A piece of ancient marble lay
across the doorway.</p>
<p>The very rudely fabricated lamp was lighted from a huge clump of wood
taken burning from the hearth.&nbsp; Dinner as uncivilised but as
hospitable as could be expected at half-past nine.&nbsp; I should have had
my own long before but for the tempest outside.</p>
<p>News arrived that eighty people from <i>Kuriet el &rsquo;Aneb</i> (the
well-known village of Abu Gosh on the Jerusalem road from Jaffa) were
escaping to us across the hills, on account of troubles at their home.</p>
<p>Then we very soon lay down to sleep.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez and
his two young sons escorted us in looking over the ruins of old
Eleutheropolis, as their town was called in the period of early
Christianity.&nbsp; These consist of a church near the great well, another
on a hill farther eastwards called St Anna, or, as the Arabs pronounce it,
<i>Sandanna</i>, and numerous extensive caverns, probably enlargements by
art from nature.</p>
<p>The former church has a roof remaining only over one of the aisles; the
ground plan of the whole edifice is, however, sufficiently marked out by
the fragments of columns <i>in situ</i>.</p>
<p>St Anna is larger and more perfect than this; the semicircular apse is
entire, and there are remains of other buildings attached to the
church.&nbsp; <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>It stands on high ground, and commands a very
fine prospect.</p>
<p>The caverns are formed in the substance of chalk hills, often in a
circular form, with a rounded roof, through which an aperture admits both
air and daylight.&nbsp; Antiquarians are puzzled to account for the origin
of these, as they are too numerous and capacious to be needed for supply of
water; besides that in common times the large well and aqueducts that bring
water from a distance would suffice for that purpose.&nbsp; They are
likewise too extensive and deep to be required for magazines of grain, such
as the villages on the open plains cut into the underground rocks for
preservation of their food from the raids of the Bedaween; perhaps,
however, some were used for one of these purposes and some for the
other.</p>
<p>Near the entrance of one of these excavations, in which there are
passages or corridors with running ornament sculptured along each side, we
found figures (now headless, of course, since the Moslem conquest)
resembling church saints in Europe&mdash;one, indeed, had its head
remaining, though disfigured, and the arms posed in the manner of the
Virgin Mary when holding the infant Saviour.&nbsp; These were sculptured in
the chalk rock itself, and standing in niches hollowed behind them.&nbsp;
If these were really what they seemed to be, they must have been made in
the era of the Latin <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>kingdom, for the Oriental Christians have
never made <i>images</i> of the saints.</p>
<p>In two other of these caverns, high up on their sides or within the
cupola, we saw short inscriptions of black paint, (if I remember rightly,)
the large characters of which had very much the general forms of
Cufic-Arabic, but not the Cufic of the old coins.&nbsp; There was also an
ornamented cross in this cupola, and other crosses in other chambers.&nbsp;
We were totally unable to satisfy ourselves as to how the inscriptions
could have been written at such inaccessible heights.&nbsp; Certainly the
present race of people are unable even to deface them, were they disposed
to do so.</p>
<p>One excavation we entered with some trouble near the top, and out of
some labyrinthine passages we descended a spiral staircase, with a low wall
to hold by in descending, all cut into the solid but soft rock; there were
also small channels for conducting water from above to the
bottom&mdash;these demonstrate the use of the whole elaborate work in this
instance, namely for holding water.</p>
<p>Returning to rest awhile in the house, &rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l &rsquo;Azeez
assured me that immensely tall as he is, he had had eight brothers, all at
least equal to himself; most of them had been killed in their faction
battles, and his father, taller than himself, had died at the age of
thirty-one.&nbsp; His sons could neither read nor write; they at one time
made a <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>beginning, but the teacher did not stay long enough to finish the
job.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the one sitting by
us, perhaps ten years of age, &ldquo;he can ride a mare so that none of our
enemies can possibly overtake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We left Bait Jibreen soon after 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
riding through a grove of olives, and soon arrived alongside of <i>Dair
Nahh&acirc;z</i>, <a name="citation182"></a><a href="#footnote182"
class="citation">[182]</a> and afterwards <i>Sen&acirc;brah</i>.&nbsp; By
noon we were quite off the plain, and entering a beautiful green valley
bounded by cliffs of rock sprinkled with dwarf evergreen oak and pines, the
spaces between them being filled up with purple cistus, yellow salvia, and
other flowers.&nbsp; This <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>continued for an hour, by which time we had
gradually attained a considerable elevation, where we had our last survey
for that journey of the Philistine plain and its glorious long limit, the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>In another quarter of an hour we rested among the wreck of <i>Khirbet en
Nas&acirc;ra</i>, (ruins of the Christians,) not far from Hebron.&nbsp;
Thence I despatched a messenger to my old friend the Pakeed (agent in
temporal affairs) of the Sephardim Jews in the city, and he sent out
provisions to my halting-place under the great oak, above a mile distant
from Hebron.</p>
<p>In regard to the researches after the lost site of Gath, I may mention
that on a later visit to Bait Jibreen, I got Shaikh Muslehh (the government
N&acirc;zir, and the head of his family) to tell me all the names of
deserted places he could recollect in his neighbourhood.&nbsp; I wrote from
his dictation as follows, but it does not seem that the object of inquiry
is among them.&nbsp; In Arabic the name would most probably be <i>Jett</i>
or <i>Jatt</i>.</p>

184</span>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; HEBRON TO BEERSHEBA, AND HEBRON TO JAFFA.</h2>
<p>In August 1849 I left my large family encampment under the branches of
the great oak of Sibta, commonly called Abraham&rsquo;s oak by most people
except the Jews, who do not believe in any Abraham&rsquo;s oak there.&nbsp;
The great patriarch planted, indeed, a grove at Beersheba; but the
&ldquo;<i>Elon&eacute; Mamre</i>&rdquo; they declare to have been
&ldquo;plains,&rdquo; not &ldquo;oaks,&rdquo; (which would be
<i>Allon&eacute; Mamre</i>,) and to have been situated northwards instead
of westwards from the present Hebron.&nbsp; With a couple of attendants I
was bound for Beersheba.&nbsp; The chief of the quarantine, not having a
soldier at home, gave us a peasant to walk with us as far as the
<i>Boorj</i>, (Tower,) with a letter of <i>our own</i> handwriting in his
name, addressed to the guard there, directing them to escort us
further.</p>
<p>Scrambling up a steep rough lane, due south from the tree, with
vineyards on either side richly laden with fruit, and occasional
sumach-trees <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>bearing bright red berries, we were rewarded on the summit by a
vast prospect of country, hilly before us in the south, Moab and Edom
mountains to the left, and Philistia plains with the Mediterranean on the
right.</p>
<p>All nature was revived by the evening sea-breeze, and the sun in
undiminished grandeur was retiring towards his rest.</p>
<p>On a summit like this, with a wide expanse laid out for survey, there
are large and lively ideas to be conceived in matters of Scriptural
geography.&nbsp; Consider, for instance, on that spot Psalm cviii., with
its detail of territories one after another.&nbsp; That &ldquo;psalm of
David&rdquo; declares that God in His holiness had decreed the future
dispensations of <i>Shechem</i>, (there is its position, Nabloos, in the
north of the circular landscape;) then the <i>valley of Succoth</i>, (there
it is, the Gh&ocirc;r, or vale of the Jordan,) coasting between
<i>Gilead</i>, <i>Manasseh</i>, and <i>Ephraim</i>; also <i>Moab</i>, with
its springs of water, where He would (speaking in human poetic language)
wash His feet, at the period of treading with His shoe over <i>Edom</i>:
that remarkable event paralleled in the Prophecy of Isaiah lxiii., when, in
apparel dyed red from Bozrah, the conqueror tramples down the people in his
anger.&nbsp; The Psalmist then has to triumph over <i>Philistia</i>, that
large Sheph&ecirc;lah stretched between us and the sea&mdash;concluding
with the exclamation, &ldquo;Who will bring me into the strong city
(Petra)? who will lead me into Edom?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>All this was accomplished by the providence of God in the history
of David, that shepherd boy of Bethlehem, at whose coronation all Israel
was gathered together at Hebron, just behind the spectator on this
eminence.</p>
<p>To return, however, from the solemnity of these historical meditations
to the commonplace transactions of the journey, we had to carry on a
considerable amount of wrangling with the muleteers, who were continually
allowing their animals to stumble, and the ropes of the luggage to come
loose, so that the things fell to the ground; I sent them back, and we
proceeded without tents or bedding, only two blankets and our cloaks.&nbsp;
The true reason of the men&rsquo;s behaviour lay in their dread of being
attacked by wild Arabs, and having their animals carried off.</p>
<p>It was about sunset, and our track lay over plains of arable land,
between hills clothed with the usual dwarf evergreens, of baloot, arbutus,
etc., then over eminences with tall fragrant pines, and the evening breeze
sighing among their branches, such as I had only once heard since leaving
Scotland, and that was in the Lebanon.&nbsp; Old stumps and half trunks of
large trees standing among myriads of infantile sprouts of pines attested
the devastation that was going on, by means of the peasantry, for making of
charcoal, and for supplying logs to the furnaces of Hebron, where very rude
manufactures of glass are carried on.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Along a glen which opened into an arable plain with stubble of
millet (durrah) remaining, but no village near.&nbsp; There we met a party
of Arab women, and after them a boy mounted on a camel, who informed us
that he was coming from <i>Merj-ed-D&ocirc;m</i>, lying between us and
<i>Samua&rsquo;</i>, where there are remains of antiquity, such as large
doorways, cisterns, etc.</p>
<p>The country was all level enough for carriages; and it is probable that
all the way in the south is practicable in like manner, for we know that
Joseph sent carriages from Egypt to his father at Beersheba.</p>
<p>The <i>Boorj</i> is simply a look-out tower, now used for quarantine
purposes, ridiculous as they may be in the pure air of the desert.</p>
<p>There are relics of a village about it; but as the people are living in
caverns rather than taking pains to rebuild their houses, we may infer that
they do not feel secure on the very last remnant of fixed habitations
towards the great southern wilderness, although under Turkish
government.</p>
<p>They are, however, kept in considerable awe of the petty officers
stationed there; for when one of our party was impatient at the intrusion
of a cat near our supper cloth, the people besought us not to injure the
animal, seeing that it was the property of the <i>Dowleh</i>
(Government.)&nbsp; They furnished us with eggs and milk; and, after our
meal, we lay down on the leeward side of the town, to await the <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>rising of
the moon.&nbsp; We had a fire burning near us, its red light flickering
over the wild scene; the sky with its milky-way over our heads, and the
polar star in the direction of England, fixed in its well-known place.</p>
<p>The villagers had their own chatting round the watchfire, discussing
local politics, chiefly, as to whether &rsquo;Abderrahhman the governor of
Hebron was likely to accept the Pasha&rsquo;s invitation to meet
&rsquo;Abdallah Wafa Effendi, who was sent with overtures of reconciliation
between the brothers of the Amer family.&nbsp; This being a question that
bore very nearly on their personal interests.</p>
<p>I awoke just as the moon gleamed in the east, but did not arouse the
youths for another half hour, till I became apprehensive of evil effects
from their sleeping in the moonlight.</p>
<p>After coffee we mounted and went forward, escorted by two of the
quarantine guardians.&nbsp; There were no more hills, but the remaining
country was all of hard untilled ground, with sprinklings of tamarisk and
kali bushes, which showed we were entering on a new botanical region.</p>
<p>Arrived at an Arab encampment, where our escort were obliged to hire the
shaikh for showing us the way, as they either did not know it, or, which I
believe the more probable, did not dare to take travellers over his land
without his sharing in the profits, even though they were officials of
quarantine.&nbsp; He soon came up, riding a fine mare of the <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>Sakl&acirc;wi race, and his spear over the shoulder, glittering
in the moonlight.&nbsp; His name was <i>Ay&acirc;n</i>, and his people were
a small offset from the great <i>Tiy&acirc;hah</i> tribe.&nbsp; We passed
several other such stations, of which we were always made aware beforehand
by the barking of their dogs, and by seeing the camels browsing or reposing
at a little distance from the tents.</p>
<p>As the night advanced, the mist rose and increased till the stars were
obscured and the moon scarcely perceptible; our clothes also became nearly
wet through.</p>
<p>We reached Beersheba (now called <i>Beer-es-Seba</i>) perhaps a couple
of hours before daylight, and after sharing some food, wrapt the blankets
over our heads, and lay down with our heads against the parapet stones of
the great well, and fell asleep, notwithstanding the cold wet mist.</p>
<p>I rose before the sun, and wrote two letters to friends in England by
morning twilight.</p>
<p>The mist disappeared as the glorious sun came forth; and we walked about
to survey the place.&nbsp; The wide plain around was disused arable land,
showing in some places some stubble from a recent harvest, but only in
small patches, which in the early spring must have been cheerful to the
sight.</p>
<p>Near us was a pretty water-course of a winter torrent, shallow and
comparatively wide, but then quite dry.</p>
<p>The great well has an internal diameter at the <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>mouth of twelve feet
six inches, or a circumference of nearly forty feet.&nbsp; The shaft is
formed of excellent masonry to a great depth until it reaches the rock, and
at this juncture a spring trickles perpetually.&nbsp; Around the mouth of
the well is a circular course of masonry, topped by a circular parapet of
about a foot high.&nbsp; And at a distance of ten or twelve feet are stone
troughs placed in a concentric circle with the well, the sides of which
have deep indentions made by the wear of ropes on the upper edges.</p>
<p>The second well, about 200 yards farther south, is not more than five
feet in diameter, but is formed of equally good masonry, and furnishes
equally good water.&nbsp; This is the most common size of ancient wells
throughout Palestine.</p>
<p>Two other wells of proportions about equal to the first well were shown
us, but they are filled to the brim with earth and stones; and Shaikh
Ay&acirc;n told us of two others.&nbsp; The barbarous practice of filling
up wells from motives of hostility was adopted at this place very soon
after Abraham had dug them.&nbsp; (Gen. xxvi. 15, etc.)&nbsp; Who can tell
how often these have been opened, closed and opened again?</p>
<p>All Arab-speaking people wish to count neither more nor less than seven
wells here, and so create the name <i>Seba</i>; but even in this way the
etymology would not hold good, for the term <i>seven wells</i> would be
<i>Seba Bear</i>, not <i>Beer-es-Seba</i>.&nbsp; From the <!-- page
191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Hebrew
history, however, we know how the designation was first given.&nbsp; Gen.
xxi. 31, &ldquo;Wherefore he called that place Beersheba, because there
they <i>sware</i> both of them,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Abraham and
Abimelech.&nbsp; Yet it deserves notice that the verb <i>to swear</i> is
identical with the numeral <i>seven</i>; and in the three preceding verses
we find Abraham ratifying the oath by a sacrifice of <i>seven</i> ewe-lambs
as a public guarantee for the fulfilment of the conditions; the killing of
lambs with this view is a usage which still obtains in the country.</p>
<p>On a rising ground near the wells are scattered lines of houses,
covering a considerable space; but all that now appears is of inferior
construction, and of no importance.</p>
<p>Soon after sunrise the Arabs of the vicinity came to water their flocks
and camels at the troughs.&nbsp; Young men stripping themselves nearly
naked, two at each well, pulled up goat-skins of water by the same rope,
hand over hand, and singing in loud merriment, with most uncivilised
screams between the verse lines.&nbsp; These men were of very dark
complexion&mdash;not quite black, but nearly so.</p>
<p>There were linnets singing also, but in far more agreeable melody; but
where they could be was more than I could discover&mdash;not a tree or a
shrub was within sight-distance.</p>
<p>After an hour we commenced our return by a different route from that of
our arrival.&nbsp; Shaikh Ay&acirc;n and Hadj &rsquo;Othman, of the
quarantine, <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>amusing themselves with jereed-playing and other mimic
man&oelig;uvres of warfare, which they performed very cleverly.</p>
<p>The shaikh being dismissed with sufficient compliments on each side, we
proceeded upon the main track from Egypt across the plain towards
<i>Doher&icirc;yeh</i>, passing occasional parcels of durrah stubble rising
out of mere scratches of the soil, varied by the wilderness plants of
tamarisk, etc.&nbsp; When one remembers the fact of that same land in the
days of Abraham and Isaac producing a hundredfold of corn, (Gen. xxvi. 12,)
how deplorable it is to see it lying untilled for want of population, and
serving only as so much space for wild tribes to roam over it!&nbsp; Surely
it will not always remain so.</p>
<p>Crossing a good road at right angles with ours, we met a large caravan
of camels going eastwards.&nbsp; The people told us they were going to
<i>Ma&rsquo;&acirc;n</i>, (beyond Petra,) one of the Hadj stations between
Damascus and Mecca, where stores of provisions are always laid up by the
Government for supply of the pilgrims at the appointed season of the
year.</p>
<p>Approaching the hills, we rested from the heat, which had become
considerable, beneath a neb&rsquo;k-tree, where all the roads between Egypt
and Hebron meet at a point.</p>
<p>At the entrance of a valley between the hills the quails were very
numerous, and so tame as to come almost under the horses&rsquo; feet.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, just at the time when wanted, my <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>fowling-piece was
found to be unloaded, that is to say, not reloaded after having gone off
yesterday by an accident.</p>
<p>It was a relief from the great heat to mount the hills to
Doher&icirc;yeh, although the road was tiresome, winding round and among
the bases of almost circular hills in succession.&nbsp; At the village all
the population was cheerfully employed in threshing or winnowing the
harvest, and their flocks crouched in the shade of the trees.&nbsp; It was
early in the afternoon, and we lay down to rest under the branches of a
fig-tree growing out of a cavern, which cavern was so large that we placed
all our horses in it.</p>
<p>We parted from the quarantine soldiers, and took a guide for
Hebron.&nbsp; The road was good and direct, through a pleasant country, so
that we made quick progress.&nbsp; At an hour and three-quarters from
Doher&icirc;yeh we arrived at a pretty glen of evergreen oak and pine; and
at the entrance of this glen is a fountain, called <i>Afeeri</i>, of
beautiful water issuing from a rock.</p>
<p>Shortly after we joined the route by which we had left our encampment
yesterday, near the fountain of <i>Dilbeh</i>, where we had drawn water
when outward bound.&nbsp; Then came to an ancient well of good masonry,
hexagonal in shape, but without water.&nbsp; A cistern for rain-water was
close adjoining.</p>
<p>Reached the oak of Sibta in twenty-eight hours after leaving it, well
pleased with having been able to <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>visit Beersheba, the
scene of many ancient and holy transactions, in the days when the great
patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, walked humbly with their God, and
God gave them a faith capable of overthrowing mountains.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I may express my regret that, although residing in the
country many years afterwards, I could not get an opportunity of visiting
either Beer-la-hai-roi or Isaac&rsquo;s well of Esek.&nbsp; (Gen. xxvi.
20.)&nbsp; Concerning the former we find some indications in an appendix to
Williams&rsquo; <i>Holy City</i>; and I have been assured personally that
the latter is still held in estimation by the Bedaween tribes, under the
name of <i>Es&acirc;k</i>, and frequented as a rendezvous for making truces
and covenants.</p>
<p>On breaking up our camp at Abraham&rsquo;s oak, the family took the
direct road for Jerusalem, while I struck across the Philistine plain for
Jaffa.</p>
<p>With one horseman and a kaww&acirc;s, I diverged westwards from the
common road just before the descent to &rsquo;Ain Dirweh, between it and
the ruined town of Bait Soor, (Bethzur of Joshua xv. 58,) leaving Hhalhhool
of the same verse on my right hand.&nbsp; Advanced gradually down a woody
glen of the usual evergreen oak and pine.&nbsp; The higher part of the
valley is in excellent cultivation, with careful walls, and drains to keep
off the winter rains that descend from the hills, although no villages were
in sight except in one place on an <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>eminence to the left,
where an apparently well-built village was entirely abandoned.&nbsp; It is
called <i>Ma&rsquo;naeen</i>; and the history of it, as I have since
learned, is that it was only a few years before built by a colony of
refugees from oppression in sundry villages, who concerted to set up on
their own account, without regard to the authority of their family
connexions, or of the hereditary shaikhs.&nbsp; So daring an innovation
upon national customs was resented by a coalition of all the country round,
who made war upon them, and dispersed the people once more to their
miserable homes.&nbsp; The Turkish Government allowed of this proceeding,
on the ground that to suffer the establishment of new villages (which of
course implies new shaikhs to rule them) would derange the account-books of
the taxes, which had been definitely fixed years before under the Egyptian
Government.</p>
<p>Lower down, where the glen became narrow and stony, a large rock has
been hewn into a chamber for some ancient hermit, not unlike the one in the
Wadi Ahhmed between Rachel&rsquo;s sepulchre and Batteer (Bether) near
Jerusalem, only in this case the entrance is shaded by venerable
karoobah-trees, so large as to cover the road also with their branches.</p>
<p>We were met by various camel-parties carrying kali for the glass-works
of Hebron during the approaching winter, also fine mats and other goods
from Damietta, which, after being landed at Jaffa, are thus conveyed by
reliefs of camels to <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>their destination of Hebron, Bethlehem, and
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>On emerging from the valley (Wadi Arab or Shaikh) into the open Vale of
&rsquo;Elah, we had <i>Khar&acirc;s</i> perched on an eminence close at our
right, and <i>Nuba</i> similarly posted to our left.</p>
<p>Also the ruins of <i>&rsquo;Elah</i> were on our left, and far behind
our left hand, in among the hills, on a commanding height, was Keelah.</p>
<p>We were now traversing the Valley of &rsquo;Elah, which runs
north-westwards, and which I have described in my former journey.&nbsp;
Now, as on that visit, I saw young shepherd lads pasturing large flocks as
David may have done over the same ground.</p>
<p>This time, however, I had entered the valley from a different
point&mdash;viz., from its eastern end at Khar&acirc;s, and not where
Shocoh and Bait Nateef lie opposite to each other.</p>
<p>We then traversed the same country as then as far as the village of
<i>Khuldah</i>, which is a very thriving place, and where, as usual, on the
wide plains there are not many flocks of sheep, but herds of horned cattle
instead, driven by men on horseback.&nbsp; This is an indication of
insecurity, on account of forays of Bedaween Arabs, from whom on their
approach they have to scamper as fast as they can.</p>
<p>The same insecurity is attested by each of these villages having its
<i>Shuneh</i>, or little rude tower <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>with a breast-work,
in which the peasants may defend themselves when in sufficient force to do
so.</p>
<p>Next came <i>Saidoon</i>, where we obtained a distant prospect of Ramlah
and Lydd, with Gimzo at the mouth of the Bethhoron Pass, (2 Chron. xxviii.
18,) and Ras-el-Ain still beyond, with its fountains and rich lands
conspicuous on the Great Plain, backed by the hills of Ephraim.&nbsp; Then
we passed the poor clay-built village of <i>De&acirc;neh</i>, where the
people were winnowing a large harvest of millet, and the Government
tax-farmers with their soldiers, lent by the authorities, measuring the
heaps.</p>
<p>Lastly, we entered the vast olive grounds belonging to Ramlah, and found
our tents (which had been sent on by another road) just as the Moeddin in
the minaret was calling to sunset prayers.</p>
<p>I am never weary of the scenery about Ramlah; we have there the most
picturesque Orientalism of all Palestine&mdash;a warm climate, numerous
waving palm-trees, with the large reservoir for cattle drinking, all gilded
in brilliant sunlight, together with the busy voices of a considerable
population.</p>
<p>A burly fellow of a wandering durweesh or sorcerer, with rows of large
black beads round his neck, came up to us, and bellowed out one of the
ninety-nine attributes of God, according to the Moslems: &ldquo;Ya
Daeem,&rdquo; (O thou everlasting!)&nbsp; This was by way of asking
alms.&nbsp; My companion gave him some, which I would not have done.</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>In the morning we ascended to the top of the great White Tower,
called &ldquo;the Tower of the Forty,&rdquo; meaning forty martyrs.&nbsp;
This is a favourite appellation of ancient ruins in Palestine.&nbsp; I do
not know what it alludes to.&nbsp; And from among the Comandalune windows I
copied the following vignette.</p>

199</span>V.&nbsp; THE LAND OF BENJAMIN.</h2>
<p>Who has ever stood upon the Scopus hill, north of Jerusalem, (his mind
first prepared by biblical reading and biblical feeling,) facing
northwards, and seeing at one glance, as upon a map, the land of the tribe
of Benjamin, without desiring to wander about there, were it only to
experience the reality of standing and breathing upon the sites of
&rsquo;Anathoth, Michmash, Gibea of Saul, and Gibeon?&nbsp; It can be most
of it performed in one day, and sometimes a line through it is traversed in
that time by English residents of Jerusalem, namely, from Jerusalem to
Michmash and Bethel, and the return.</p>
<p>There is also a pleasant spot above Lifta, in a grove of olives, figs,
and pomegranates, where Europeans have sometimes established summer camps
for their families.&nbsp; At that spot it is delightful to repose in the
evening shadows cast by the trees, and gaze over the landscape of Benjamin,
with a deep valley sinking in immediate front, only to rise again to the
greater height of Nebi Samwil and a landscape view extending as far as the
rock <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Rimmon, which stands in pyramidal form upon the horizon.</p>
<p>There are, however, several ancient and biblical sites known to exist
within that circuit that are not visible from either of those stations, and
only to be perceived on reaching the places themselves.&nbsp; For instance,
Bait Hhaneena of Nehemiah xi. 32.</p>
<p>There is <i>&rsquo;Ad&acirc;sa</i>, the scene of a great victory gained
by Judas Maccabaeus over the mighty host of Nicanor; this I discovered from
the peasants ploughing one day, while resting after a gazelle chase.&nbsp;
It is not far from Gibeon.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem,
and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host of Syrians met him.&nbsp;
But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men. . . .&nbsp; So the
thirteenth day of the month Adar [<i>i.e.</i> on the eve of Purim] the
hosts joined battle: but Nicanor&rsquo;s host was discomfited, and he
himself was first slain in the battle . . . .&nbsp; Then they pursued after
them a day&rsquo;s journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm after
them with their trumpets,&rdquo; (Macc. vii. 39-45,) <i>i.e.</i> a
day&rsquo;s journey for an army, perhaps, that day&rsquo;s journey after
fighting; for it is a pleasant ride with respect to distance, as I proved
by riding to <i>Jadeerah</i>, passing through Beer Neb&acirc;la.</p>
<p>And on another day&rsquo;s expedition alone, I was riding near
&rsquo;An&acirc;ta (Anathoth) eastwards from the village, thinking over the
faith of the prophet Jeremiah, in purchasing a family estate, the future
occupation of which was contrary to all human <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>probability, and
after recounting to myself the cities of Benjamin allotted to the priests,
as Anathoth, (to which the treasonable priest Abiathar belonged, 1 Kings
ii. 26,) Gibeon, and Geba, wondering what had become of the fourth city
Almon, (Josh. xxi. 17, 18,) I came up to a hill on which appeared some
remains of an ancient town; there my horse carried me up the steep side,
and while passing among the lines of foundations on the summit, a peasant
who joined me said the place was called <i>&rsquo;Alm&acirc;n</i>.&nbsp;
Some time afterwards, I was riding on the other side of the same hill, in
the direction of <i>Hhizmeh</i>, (the Az-maveth of Neh. vii. 28, as I
suppose,) when a peasant informed me that the place on the hill was named
<i>Almeet</i>.&nbsp; This corresponds to the other name of the town as
given in 1 Chron. vi. 60, and vii. 8, where it is Alemeth.&nbsp; So
remarkable a preservation of both names by another people than the Jews,
after long or perhaps repeated desolations, appears to me almost
miraculous, and is a fresh illustration of the exact verbal inspiration of
Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>I once visited the rock Rimmon of Judges xx. 47.&nbsp; The first part of
the journey was made in company with Lieutenant Vandevelde, going from
Jericho to Bethel, a totally-unknown road; it must have been the same as
that taken by Joshua after the fall of Jericho.</p>
<p>This was in 1852.&nbsp; The Arabs were unwilling to take us in that
direction, probably on account <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>of some local hostilities to which they might
be exposed.&nbsp; At first they denied there was any road that way, then
said it was so difficult that we could not reach Bethel in less than two
days, which was ridiculous, considering the shortness of the
distance.&nbsp; At length we resolved to find a road without them, and
ordered the luggage to go round by Khatroon, or if necessary by Jerusalem,
but to meet us at Bethel that night.</p>
<p>Shaikh Mohammed el Hejj&acirc;z then sent with us his slave
Sulim&acirc;n.&nbsp; By his having that Moslem name, I should suppose this
to be a freed-man, inasmuch as it is not the custom to give Moslem or
Christian names to slaves; they may be only called Jewel, Diamond,
Cornelian, Thursday, Friday, etc.&nbsp; It is not uncommon for a freed-man
to be still called in popular speech <i>a slave</i>; but not in serious
earnest or in matters of business, and not unless they are blacks from
Africa.</p>
<p>It is not unusual in the East for a slave, even though still in bondage,
to be educated in reading and writing, to be trained in military
accomplishments, and so to be employed as confidential agent of property,
or trainer of children in the family, riding the best horses and carrying
weapons of best quality.&nbsp; And this Sulim&acirc;n was a bright specimen
of that class of men,&mdash;of good bodily presence, merry-humoured, and
well-accoutred.</p>
<p>The first part of the journey in crossing the Quarantana mountain was
precipitous, and even <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>dangerous for strangers; but the summit being
attained, the whole of the remaining distance was a level plain.&nbsp; We
were upon remains of an ancient road, with wells frequently occurring by
the wayside; many of them, however, choked up with stones and earth.</p>
<p>Plodded quietly along, when, about two hours from Jericho, we were
surprised by hearing human wailing and cries for mercy near us.&nbsp; This
was discovered to come from a boy of about twelve years of age who had
concealed himself behind a bush of <i>ret&rsquo;m</i>, (juniper of
Scripture.)&nbsp; He had never seen Europeans before, and, on perceiving
the Hejj&acirc;z slave at our head, was apprehensive that we should plunder
him of his ass and her foal.&nbsp; He was a peasant of <i>Dair
Dew&acirc;n</i>, <a name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a> a village on the way before us.</p>
<p>In half an hour more we came up to a cleanly-dressed and
pleasant-looking shepherd lad, who was not at all afraid of us.&nbsp; He
conducted us to a well of good water, named <i>Beer Mustafa</i>, a little
off the road, at the heading of the small wadi <i>Krishneh</i>; there we
rested half an hour.</p>
<p>In another hour we reached the ruins of Abu Sabb&acirc;kh, from which we
had <i>Remmoon</i> visible on our right.</p>
<p>During all the day&rsquo;s journey we passed through a good deal of
wheat and barley cultivation, the crops ripening fast, it being at the
beginning of May.</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>In another half hour we arrived at Dair Dew&acirc;n, the
Beth-aven of Scripture, <a name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a> a flourishing village,&mdash;remarkably so, as
evinced by its buildings, its fruit orchards, and corn fields all
around.&nbsp; Progress in such affairs is a sure token of a village being
peopled by Christians.&nbsp; In the well-kept cemetery belonging to the
place, it was pleasant to see an enormous quantity of large blue iris
flowers growing between the graves, and often concealing them from view
till nearly approached.</p>
<p>Turning abruptly westward, in twenty minutes we came to the hill of
stones called Tell-el-hajjar, which I had on a former occasion identified
as the site of Ai, lying as it does between Beth-aven and Bethel, (Josh.
viii.,) and having the deep valley alongside northwards.&nbsp; Here
Vandevelde took bearings, with his theodolite, of points within sight; and
in a quarter of an hour from this we reached Bethel, (now called Bait-een,)
that is in less than five hours, including an hour&rsquo;s stoppage at the
Tell from the &rsquo;Ain-es-Sult&acirc;n by Jericho, where the Arabs had,
for their own reasons, tried to persuade us that the journey was
impossible, or would at least occupy two days.</p>
<p>Our tents and luggage arrived soon after we did.&nbsp; Bait-een has been
so often described, and its biblical events so often quoted by travellers,
that it is not necessary to do so while professedly dealing only <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>with byeways
in Palestine; yet this may be said, that no distance of time can entirely
efface the exquisite pleasure of exploring ground and sites so accurately
corresponding as this did to the topography of the Bible, and belonging to
events of such antiquity as the acts of Abraham and Joshua.</p>
<p>In the morning I separated from my friends, who were preceding towards
Damascus, and, accompanied by Sulim&acirc;n and a kaww&acirc;s, went on my
way to <i>Remmoon</i>, (the rock Rimmon.)&nbsp; Started at half-past seven
in a thick shirocco atmosphere, keeping on the northern high road for about
a quarter of an hour in the direction of <i>Yebrood</i>, then turned
sharply eastwards over corn-fields, and descended into a deep hot
valley.&nbsp; The flowers of the field were chiefly cistus, red or white,
and hollyhocks four feet high.&nbsp; Then ascended to at least a
corresponding height into terraces of fruit-trees well-cultivated; and
still mounting, to a fine plain of wheat, at the end of which was Remmoon,
one hour and a quarter from Bait-een.</p>
<p>The village is built upon a mass of calcareous rock, commanding
magnificent views towards the south, including the Dead Sea and the line of
the Jordan; higher hills bounded the north, on which was conspicuous the
town of <i>Tayibeh</i>, near which is a <i>weli</i> or <i>mez&acirc;r</i>
(pilgrimage station) named after St George, who is an object of veneration
to both Moslems and Christians.&nbsp; The people of Tayibeh <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>are all or
mostly Christians, and have a church with a resident priest.</p>
<p>We rode up the street of Remmoon, and found the shaikh and principal men
of the town lazily smoking in the shadow of a house.</p>
<p>My object was of course to inquire for a cavern that might be capable of
containing six hundred men during four months.&nbsp; The people all denied
the existence of such a cavern, but after some parley I was conducted to
two separate caverns on the west side of the hill, then to two others on
the eastern side which are larger, and to each of which we had to arrive
through a house built at its opening.&nbsp; They told me of two others upon
the hill, but of much inferior size.&nbsp; Those that I entered were not
remarkable for dimensions above the many that are to be found over the
country.&nbsp; It is probable that the whole of the refugees might sleep in
these several places, if there were no village there at the time, which
seems probable; but it was merely my own preconceived notion that they all
lived in one vast cavern.&nbsp; The text of Judg. xx. 47 does not say
so.</p>
<p>The village is in good condition, and the cultivation excellent in every
direction around it.&nbsp; On leaving it for the return to Jerusalem I
proceeded due southwards.&nbsp; In the fields the people were industriously
clearing away stones&mdash;a sure symptom of peace, and consequent
improvement.</p>
<p>Crossed a valley named <i>Ma&rsquo;kook</i>, and arrived at <!-- page
207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span><i>Mukhin&acirc;s</i> (Michmash) in less than two hours from
Remmoon.&nbsp; Rested in the fine grove of olive-trees in the valley on the
north of the town for an hour.&nbsp; The birds were singing delightfully,
though the time was high noon, and our horses enjoyed some respite from the
sanguinary green flies which had plagued them all the way from Remmoon;
their bellies and fetlocks were red with bleeding.&nbsp; In this matter I
particularly admired the benevolence of the slave Sulim&acirc;n.&nbsp;
Yesterday, after a sharp run across a field, perhaps in the vain hope of
escaping the tormentors, he dismounted, and the mare followed him, walking
like a lamb.&nbsp; He then sat down to switch away the flies, and rub her
legs inwards and outwards.&nbsp; To-day he had taken off his Bedawi kefieh,
or bright-coloured small shawl, from around his head, and suspended it
between her legs, then, as he rode along, was continually switching between
her ears with a long bunch of the wild mustard-plant.</p>
<p>On leaving Mukhm&acirc;s in the hottest part of the day, we had to cross
the Wadi <i>S&ucirc;aineet</i>, along which to our left appeared the
northern extremity of the Dead Sea.&nbsp; At a short distance down the
valley there are remarkable precipices on each side, which must be the
Bozez and Seneh, <a name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a> renowned for the bold adventure of Jonathan and
his armour-bearer, <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>and near these projections are some large old
karoobah-trees.</p>
<p>Emerging upwards from this wadi one comes to <i>Jeba&rsquo;</i>, (the
Gibeah of Saul, so often mentioned,) upon a table-land extending due east,
in which direction I visited, five years before, an ancient ruin, which the
people of Jeba&rsquo; call <i>El Kharjeh</i>; it consisted of one principal
building of contiguous chambers, built of nicely squared stones, put
together without cement, like several of the remains at Bethel.</p>
<p>These stones are gray with weather stains, but seldom more than three
courses in height remain in their places, though in one place five.</p>
<p>From this site, as well as from Jeba&rsquo;, there is a very striking
view of the northern extremity of the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The guide told us of a vast cavern in the Wadi S&ucirc;aineet capable of
holding many hundred men, near to the above-mentioned karoobah-trees, and
therefore just the suitable refuge for the Israelites, (I Sam. xiv. 11,)
besides the Bozez and Seneh; and he told us that half-way down the
precipice there is a course of water running towards the Gh&ocirc;r.</p>
<p>Few incidents in the Bible are so real to the eye and feelings as the
narrative of Jonathan and his office-bearers when read upon the spot of the
occurrence, or near it at Jeba&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We passed <i>Jeba&rsquo;</i> at about a quarter of a mile to <!-- page
209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>our right,
and in another quarter of an hour were at the strange old stone
parallelograms under <i>Hhizmeh</i>, which had been often before visited in
afternoon rides from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>These are piles of large squared stones of great antiquity, carefully
built into long parallel forms, and now deeply weather-eaten.&nbsp; No use
of them can be imagined.&nbsp; I have visited them at all seasons of the
year, and at different hours of the day, but they still remain
unintelligible.&nbsp; They are disposed in different directions, as will be
seen in the following drawing of them, carefully taken by measurement in my
presence, and given me by a friend now in England, the Rev. G. W. Dalton of
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p209.jpg">
<img alt="Stone constructions under Hhizmeh" src="images/p209.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On one face of No. 4 is a kind of entrance, and on the top surface a
round hole about two feet in depth, but they lead to nothing, and are
probably the work of modern peasantry, removing stones from the entire
block; in the former case for the mere object of shade from the sun, and
the latter for the charitable purpose common among <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Moslems, who often
cut basins into solid rocks, to collect rain or dew for birds of the air or
beasts of the field.</p>
<p>Corroded monuments like these, in so pure and dry an atmosphere, bespeak
a far more hoary antiquity than the same amount of decay would do in an
English climate.</p>
<p>I know of a spot on the side of a wild hill upon the way between Ai (as
I believe the place called the <i>Tell</i> to be) and Mukhm&acirc;s, where
there are several huge slabs of stone, rather exceeding human size, laid
upon the ground side by side exactly parallel.&nbsp; These can be nothing
else than gravestones of early Israelitish period, but of which the
memorial is now gone for ever.</p>
<p>Crossing the torrent-bed from the parallelogram, and mounting the next
hill, we were at Hhizmeh; then leaving &rsquo;An&acirc;ta on the left, we
traversed the Scopus near the Mount of Olives, and reached Jerusalem in
four hours and a half of easy riding from Remmoon.</p>
<p>One ought not to quit the mention of this land of Benjamin by omitting
the <i>Wadi Farah</i>.</p>
<p>This is a most delightsome valley, with a good stream of water, at a
distance of rather more than two hours from Jerusalem to the N.E.</p>
<p>The way to it is through &rsquo;An&acirc;ta, already described, from
which most of the stones were quarried for the English church in the Holy
City, and then alongside the hill on which stands <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>the ruins with the
double name of &rsquo;Alm&acirc;n and &rsquo;Almeet, discovered by me as
above-described.</p>
<p>Once, in the autumn season, a party of us went to Wadi Farah, and
arriving on its precipitous brink found the descent too difficult for the
horses; these, therefore, were left in charge of the servants, while we
skipped or slid from rock to rock, carrying the luncheon with us.</p>
<p>The copious stream was much choked near its source, which rises from the
ground, by a thick growth of reeds, oleanders in blossom, and gigantic
peppermint with strong smell.&nbsp; There were small fish in the stream,
which was flowing rapidly; wild pigeons were numerous, and a shepherd boy
playing his reed pipe, brought his flock to the water.&nbsp; Need it be
said, how refreshing all this was to us all after the long summer of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>There were remains of a bridge and considerable fragments of old
aqueducts, <i>i.e.</i>, good-sized tubes of pottery encased in masonry, but
now so broken as to be quite useless; these lead from the spring-head
towards the Jordan at different levels, one above another.&nbsp; There was
also a cistern of masonry, with indications of water-machinery having been
at one time employed there; but all these evidences of population and
industry are abandoned to savages and the action of the elements.</p>
<p>Dr James Barclay of Virginia, author of &ldquo;The City of the Great
King,&rdquo; believes this site to be <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>that of
&ldquo;&AElig;non, near to Salim,&rdquo; where John was baptizing,
&ldquo;because there was much water there,&rdquo; (John iii. 23.)</p>
<p>There can scarcely be a doubt that it is the <i>Parah</i>, belonging to
the tribe of Benjamin, in Josh. xviii. 23, and that therefore it was a
settled and cultivated place before the children of Israel took possession
of the land.</p>
<p>The district around,&mdash;indeed, all eastwards of
&rsquo;An&acirc;ta,&mdash;is now unappropriated; parts of it, however, are
sown&mdash;not always the same patches in successive years&mdash;by the
people of the nearest villages in a compulsory partnership with the petty
Arabs of the Jordan plain.&nbsp; The peasantry are forced to find the seed
and the labour, and yet are often defrauded of their share of the produce
by the so-called partners bringing up friends and auxiliaries from the
plain, just as the grain is ripening, and carrying off the produce by
night, or setting fire to whatever they cannot seize in this hasty
operation; and this takes place about two hours from the citadel and
garrison of Jerusalem.&nbsp; Do not ask where is the Turkish
government!</p>
<p>The people are driven to sow the grain upon these conditions, under risk
of having their own crops destroyed or devastated near their homesteads,
and in no case dare they offer any resistance.</p>
<p>I was once unwillingly present at a grievous scene near Elisha&rsquo;s
fountain.&nbsp; N&acirc;s&rsquo;r Abu&rsquo; N&rsquo;sair, <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>shaikh of
the Ehteim&acirc;t, one of the parties at all times in the above-described
partnerships, was seated smoking his chibook beneath an old neb&rsquo;k
tree when some Christian peasants from <i>Tayibeh</i> approached him with
deep humility, begging permission to sow grain upon that marvellously
fertile plain of Jericho.&nbsp; For some reason which did not appear, it
suited him to refuse the favour.&nbsp; In vain the suppliants raised their
bidding of the proportion to be given him from the proceeds; they then
endeavoured to get me to intercede in their behalf, frequently making the
sign of the cross upon themselves, thereby invoking my sympathy as a
fellow-Christian on their side; but on several accounts it seemed most
prudent for me to leave the parties to their own negotiations, only
speaking on their behalf afterwards by sending a kaww&acirc;s to recommend
kindness in general to the Christian villages.&nbsp; It may be that this
step met with success, but I could not but be sincerely desirous to have
such Arab vermin as these mongrel tribes swept off the land.</p>

214</span>VI.&nbsp; SEBUSTIEH TO CAIFFA.</h2>
<p>In October, 1848, I found myself at Sebustieh, the ancient Samaria,
having come thither from Jerusalem by the common route through Nabloos,
<i>i.e.</i>, Shechem.&nbsp; Since that time I have often been there, but
never without a feeling of very deep interest, not only in the beauty of
its site, worthy of a royal city, or in the Roman remains still subsisting,
but also in the remarkable fulfilments of Biblical prophecy which the place
exhibits.&nbsp; The stones of the ancient buildings are literally poured
down into the valley, and the foundations thereof discovered, (Micah i.
6.)</p>
<p>We left the hill and its miserable village by the usual track through a
gateway at its eastern side.&nbsp; Down in the valley lay fragments of
large mouldings of public buildings, and the lid of a sarcophagus reversed,
measuring eight feet in length.</p>
<p>At first we took the common road northwards, and ascending the hill
above <i>Burka</i>, from the summit had a glorious prospect of the sea on
one <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>side, and of the populous village country, well cultivated,
stretched before us; we left the common road to <i>Sanoor</i> and
<i>Jeneen</i>, turning aside under <i>Seeleh</i>, a double village nearest
to us, with <i>At&acirc;ra</i> further west.</p>
<p>The muleteers had preceded us during our survey of Sebustieh, on the way
to &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh, and we could see nothing of them before
us&mdash;the road was unknown to us, and no population could be seen, all
keeping out of sight of us and of each other on account of the alarm of
cholera then raging in the country.</p>
<p>At Nabloos that morning, two hours before noon, we had been told of
twenty having been already buried that day, and we saw some funerals taking
place.&nbsp; At Sebustieh, the people had refused for any money to be our
guides; one youth said, &ldquo;he was afraid of the death that there was in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So my companion and I, with a kaww&acirc;s, paced on till arriving near
sunset at a deserted village standing on a precipice which rose above a
tolerably high hill, and which from a distance we had been incorrectly told
was &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh; at that distance it had not the appearance of
being depopulated, as we found it to be on reaching it.&nbsp; Numerous
villages were in view, but no people visible to tell us their names.&nbsp;
The district was utterly unknown to maps, as it lies out of the common
travellers&rsquo; route.&nbsp; This village, we afterwards <!-- page
216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>learned, is
<i>Rami</i>, and antique stones and wells are found there.&nbsp; Though our
horses were much fatigued, it was necessary to go on in search of our
people and property, for the sun was falling rapidly.</p>
<p>Observing a good looking village far before us to the N.W., and a path
leading in that direction, we followed it through a wood of low shrubs, and
arrived at the village, a place strong by nature for military defence, and
its name is <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Ra&rsquo;i</i>.&nbsp; There was a view of the
sea and the sun setting grandly into it.</p>
<p>For high pay, we obtained a youth to guide us to &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh;
shouldering his gun, he preceded us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;why we are called Cuf&rsquo;r Ra&rsquo;i?&mdash;It is because
the word Cuf&rsquo;r means blaspheming infidels, and so we are&mdash;we
care for nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, his derivation was grammatically
wrong; for the word, which is common enough out of the Jerusalem district
and the south, is the Hebrew word for a village, still traditionally in
use, and this place is literally, &ldquo;the shepherd&rsquo;s
village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed an ancient sepulchre cut in the rock by our wayside, with
small niches in it to the right and left; the material was coarse, and so
was the workmanship, compared to ours about Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The moon rose&mdash;a jackal crossed a field within a few yards of
us.&nbsp; We passed through a large village called <i>Fahh&rsquo;mah</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, charcoal, with <!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>fragments of old buildings and one
palm-tree.&nbsp; Forwards over wild green hills, along precipices that
required extreme caution.&nbsp; The villages around were discernible by
their lights in the houses.&nbsp; At length &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh appeared,
with numerous and large lights, and we could hear the ring of
blacksmiths&rsquo; hammers and anvils&mdash;we seemed almost to be
approaching a manufacturing town in &ldquo;the black country of
England.&rdquo; <a name="citation217"></a><a href="#footnote217"
class="citation">[217]</a></p>
<p>Arrived on a smooth meadow at the foot of the long hill on which the
place is built, I fired pistols as a signal to our people should they be
there to hear it, and one was fired in answer.&nbsp; To that spot we went,
and found the tents and our people, but neither tents set up nor
preparations for supper.&nbsp; Village people stood around, but refused to
give or sell us anything, and using defiant language to all the consuls and
pashas in the world.</p>
<p>Till that moment I had not been aware that this was the citadel of the
&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Hadi&rsquo;s factions, and a semi-fortification.&nbsp;
[Since that time, I have had opportunities of seeing much more of the
people and the place.]</p>
<p>Sending a kaww&acirc;s to the castle, with my compliments to the Bek, I
requested guards for the night, and loading my pistols afresh, stood with
them in my hand, as did my second kaww&acirc;s with his gun, and we
commenced erecting the tents.</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>Down came the kaww&acirc;s in haste to announce that the Bek was
coming himself to us, attended by his sons and a large train.</p>
<p>First came his nephew from his part, to announce the advent; then a
deputation of twenty; and then himself, robed in scarlet and sable fur, on
a splendid black horse of high breed.&nbsp; I invited him to sit with me on
my bed within the tent, widely open.&nbsp; The twenty squatted in a circle
around us, and others stood behind them; and a present was laid before me
of a fine water-melon and a dozen of pomegranates.</p>
<p>Never was a friendship got up on shorter notice.&nbsp; We talked
politics and history, which I would rather have adjourned to another time,
being very tired and very hungry.</p>
<p>He assured me that when my pistols were heard at the arrival, between
700 and 800 men rushed to arms, supposing there was an invasion of their
foes, the Tok&acirc;n and Jerr&acirc;r, or perhaps an assault by the
Pasha&rsquo;s regulars from Jerusalem, under the pretext of cholera
quarantine&mdash;in either case they got themselves ready.</p>
<p>He stayed long, and then went to chat with my Arab secretary in his
tent, leaving me to eat my supper.&nbsp; He gave orders for a strong guard
to be about us for the night, and a party to guide us in the morning on our
way to Carmel.</p>
<p>This personage (as he himself told me) had been the civil governor
inside of Acre during the <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>English bombardment of 1840; and his brother
had first introduced the Egyptians into the country eleven years before
that termination of their government.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In 1852 I had arrived at &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh from Nabloos by a different
route, and turned from this place not seawards as now, but inland to
Jeneen: whence I again visited it on my return.&nbsp; It seems worth while
to give the details of this route.</p>
<p>Starting from Nabloos at half-past ten we passed <i>Zuw&acirc;tah</i>
close on our right, and <i>Bait Uzan</i> high up on the left.&nbsp; Here
the aqueduct conveying water from the springs under Gerizim to gardens far
westwards, was close to the high-road.&nbsp; Arriving at <i>Sebustieh</i>
and going on to <i>Burka</i> we quitted the Jeba&rsquo; road, and turned to
<i>Seeleh</i> which lay on our left, and <i>Fendecom&icirc;a</i> high up on
the right, <i>Jeba&rsquo;</i> being in sight.</p>
<p>Soon after this we turned sharply north-west to <i>&rsquo;Ajjeh</i>, and
thence arrived at &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh in five and a half hours from
Nabloos.</p>
<p>After leaving &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh for Jeneen we got upon a fine plain,
namely, that of Dothan.&nbsp; On this, near to another road leading to
Kab&acirc;tiyeh, is a beautiful low hill, upon which stands Dothan, the
only building left to represent the ancient name being a cow-shed; however,
at the foot of the hill is a space of bright green sward, whence issues a
plentiful stream of sparkling water, and here <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>among some trees is a
rude stone building.&nbsp; This spot is now called <i>Hafeereh</i>, but the
whole site was anciently Dothan, this name having been given me by one
peasant, and Dotan by another.</p>
<p>On my return hither a few days later I found a large herd of cattle, and
many asses going to drink at the spring.&nbsp; Dothan is well known to
shepherds now as a place of resort, and must have been so in ancient
times.&nbsp; Here then, in the very best part of the fertile country of
Ephraim, is the pasture-ground to which Joseph&rsquo;s brethren had removed
their flocks from the paternal estate at Shechem, and where they sold their
brother to the Arab traders on their way to Egypt.&nbsp; This may help to
mark the season of the year at which Joseph was bought and sold.&nbsp; It
could only be at the end of the summer that the brethren would need to
remove their flocks from exhausted pasture-ground at Shechem to the
perennial spring and green watered land at Dothan; this would also be
naturally the season for the Ishmaelite caravan to carry produce into Egypt
after the harvest was ended.&nbsp; Be it remembered that the articles they
were conveying were produce from the district of Gilead&mdash;(&ldquo;balm
of Gilead&rdquo; is mentioned later in Scripture)&mdash;and it is specially
interesting to notice that Jacob&rsquo;s present, sent by his brethren to
the unknown ruler in Egypt, consisted of these same best fruits,
&ldquo;Take of the best fruits of the land, balm, honey, spices and myrrh,
nuts and almonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Dothan is about half an hour distant from &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh,
and therefore six hours or a morning&rsquo;s walk for a peasant from
Shechem.</p>
<p>More solemn, however, than the above interesting recollection, was that
of the horses and chariots of fire which had encircled the very hill upon
which I stood, when Elisha &ldquo;the man of God,&rdquo; lived in Dothan,
and smote the Syrian army at the foot with blindness, and led them away to
Sebustieh, (Samaria,) 2 Kings vi.</p>
<p>After leaving Dothan, at the falling in of this road to Jeneen with that
from Kab&acirc;tieh, stands a broken tower on an eminence above the well
<i>Bel&acirc;meh</i>, which Dr Schultz has identified with the Belmen,

<p>To resume&mdash;Away early in the morning.&nbsp; Paid the night-guard
and sent a present of white loaf bread and some tea to the Bek.</p>
<p>It was promised that we should reach Carmel in nine hours, across an
unknown but pretty country in a different direction from Lejjoon and
Ta&rsquo;annuk (Taanach of Judges i. 27,) which I had designed for my
route, and towards the sea-coast.</p>
<p>Our guides were gigantic men, beside whom my tall peasant servant
Khaleel appeared to disadvantage, and their guns were of a superior
description to what one commonly sees in Palestine.&nbsp; The peasantry
also were large men with good guns.</p>
<p><!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>First, due west for quarter of an hour towards <i>Kubrus</i>,
situated upon a hill, but before reaching it, turned sharply northwards,
through a rocky defile of ten minutes, when we fell in with a better road
which, they said, came also from &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh, and on towards a fine
village named <i>Yaabad</i> in a lovely plain richly cultivated; there were
after the earlier crops young plantations of cotton rising, the fields
cleared of stones and fenced in by the most regular and orderly of stone
dykes.</p>
<p>Before reaching <i>Yaabad</i>, we turned due west, our guides alone
being able to judge which of the many footpaths could be the right one.</p>
<p>Reached the poor village <i>Zebdeh</i>, then over a green hill with a
prospect of the sea.&nbsp; C&aelig;sarea visible at a distance, and in the
middle distance <i>Jit</i> and <i>Zeita</i>.&nbsp; Near us were ruins of a
strong place called <i>Burtaa</i>, said to have a supply of delicious
water.&nbsp; Our journey was all over short evergreens rising from stony
ground.&nbsp; So lonely&mdash;none in sight but ourselves for hours after
hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Green is the portion of Paradise&rdquo; exclaimed our
people.</p>
<p>At <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Kara</i>, a clean mud village in the fragments of
columns lying about, we rested beneath some huge fig-trees while the
luggage, guarded by some of the escort, jogged forwards; for muleteers
never like resting their animals, or at least do not like unpacking them
before the end of the day&rsquo;s march; the trouble is too great in
reloading them.&nbsp; The riding horses were tied up under the <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>trees, and
we got some melons and eggs from the village.</p>
<p>After an hour we remounted and went on steadily north-west.&nbsp; Soon
reached <i>Kaneer</i>, where was a cistern with wide circular opening of
large masonry, bespeaking high antiquity.</p>
<p>Then to <i>Sub&acirc;riyeh</i> on a small rise from a hollow with one
palm-tree.&nbsp; The well was at a distance from the village, and the women
washing there.&nbsp; One man asked one of them to move away while he filled
our matara (leathern bottle.)&nbsp; She said she would not even for Ibrahim
Pasha, whereupon he roared out, &ldquo;One sees that the world is changed,
for if you had spoken in that manner to one of Ibrahim&rsquo;s meanest of
grooms, he would have burned down your town for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
matara was then filled.</p>
<p>In another quarter of an hour we were pacing through a wide Riding (as
we use the term in the old English Forests for a broad avenue between
woods.)&nbsp; This opened into a plain of rich park scenery, with timbered
low hills all about, only of course no grass: in the centre of this stands
<i>Zum&acirc;reen</i>, perched on a bold piece of rock.&nbsp; Many of the
trees were entirely unknown to us Southerners; some of the evergreens were
named to us as Maloch, etc., and there were bushes of Saris with red
berries.</p>
<p>Out of this we emerged upon the plain of the sea-coast, at a wretched
village bearing the <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>attractive name of <i>Furadees</i>
(Paradise.)&nbsp; Here the people were sifting their corn after its
thrashing, and we got a boy to refresh us with milk from his flock of
goats.&nbsp; Only those experiencing similar circumstances of hot
travelling, can conceive the pleasure of this draught, especially after
having had to gallop round the boy, and coax and threaten him to sell the
milk for our money.</p>
<p>The way lay due north, hugging to the hills parallel to the sea, but at
a distance from it: numerous wadis run inland, and at the mouth of each is
a village.&nbsp; The first was <i>Su&acirc;meh</i>, the next <i>&rsquo;Ain
el Ghaz&acirc;l</i>, (Gazelles fountain,) wretched like the rest, but in a
pretty situation&mdash;then <i>Modzha</i>, and <i>Mazaal</i>, and
<i>&rsquo;Ain Hhood</i>, (a prosperous looking place,) and
<i>Teeri</i>.</p>
<p>The sun set in the blue water, and we were still far from
Carmel&mdash;our animals could scarcely move: sometimes we dismounted and
led them&mdash;passed the notable ruins of Tantoorah, (Dora of the Bible,)
and Athleet on our left&mdash;moonlight and fatigue.&nbsp; There was a
nearer way from Zum&acirc;reen, but it would have been hilly and
wearisome.&nbsp; After a long while we overtook our muleteers without the
baggage, for the Kaww&acirc;s Salim, they said, had been so cruel to them
that they had allowed him to go on with the charge towards Carmel.</p>
<p>At length we climbed up the steep to the convent.&nbsp; Being very late
we experienced great difficulty in gaining admission.&nbsp; There was no
food <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>allowed to the servants, no barley for the horses, and for a long
time no water supplied.</p>
<p>In the morning we found great changes had taken place since 1846.&nbsp;
The kind president had gone on to India&mdash;the apothecary Fra Angelo was
removed to a distance&mdash;John-Baptist was at Caiffa and unwell.&nbsp;
The whole place bore the appearance of gloom, bigotry, dirtiness, and bad
management.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I left the convent, in order to enjoy a perfect Sabbath
on the morrow in tents at the foot of the hill, open to the sea breeze of
the north, and with a grand panorama stretched out before us.</p>
<p>And a blessed day that was.&nbsp; We were all in need of bodily rest,
ourselves, the servants and the cattle&mdash;and it was enjoyed to the
full&mdash;my young friend and I derived blessing and refreshment also from
the word of God.&nbsp; The words, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,&rdquo; seemed to have a
reviving significance, as well as those of &ldquo;Whosoever drinketh of the
water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall
give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a Sabbath in the Holy Land is true enjoyment.</p>

226</span>VII.&nbsp; ESDRAELON PLAIN AND ITS VICINITY.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>May</i> 1851.</p>
<p>From Jeneen, (En-gannim, Josh. xxi. 29,) to Acre, <i>i.e.</i>, towards
the north-west, and skirting the great plain under the line of the hills of
Samaria,&mdash;thus following the western coast of Zebulon to the south of
Asher.</p>
<p>The road was enlivened by numerous companies of native people travelling
from village to village.</p>
<p>In an hour and a half from Jeneen we were at <i>Seeleh</i>, a cheerful
and prosperous-looking place; and in three-quarters of an hour more we were
abreast of both <i>Ta&rsquo;annuk</i> and <i>Salim</i>, at equal distances
of quarter of an hour from the highway; the former on our left hand, and
the latter on the right.&nbsp; These places were at that time tolerably
well peopled.</p>
<p>Here we gained the first view of Mount Tabor from a westerly direction,
and indeed it was curious all along this line to see in unusual aspects the
well-remembered sites that lie eastwards or northwards from Jeneen, such as
Zera&rsquo;een (Jezreel,) <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Jilboon (Gilboa,) Solam (Shunem,) or Fooleh
and Afooleh.&nbsp; In fact, we overlooked the tribe or inheritance of
Zebulon from Carmel to Tabor.</p>
<p>With respect to the circumstance of numerous passengers, whom we met
this morning, it was a pleasant exception to the common experience of that
district, where it is often as true now as in the days of Shamgar the son
of Anath (see Judges v. 6), that the population fluctuates according to the
invasions or retiring of tyrannical strangers.&nbsp; That vast plain
affords a tempting camping-ground for remote Arabs to visit in huge swarms
coming from the East with their flocks for pasture; and in the ancient
times this very site between Ta&rsquo;annuk and Lejjoon, being the opening
southwards, gave access to the Philistines or Egyptians arriving in their
chariots from the long plain of Sharon, or a passage over this plain to
that of the great hosts of Syria under the Ptolemies, with their
elephants.</p>
<p>In all ages the poor peasantry here have been the victims of similar
incursions, &ldquo;the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
through byeways.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet though chased away from their homes, the
populations returned, whenever possible, with pertinacious attachment to
their devastated dwellings, and hence we have still the very names of the
towns and villages perpetuated by a resident people after a lapse of almost
thirty-three hundred years since the allotment made by Joshua, (xiii.-xxi.,
etc.,) and the names were not then new.</p>
<p><!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>I have myself known villages on the Plain of Esdraelon to be
alternately inhabited or abandoned.&nbsp; At one time Fooleh was a heap of
ruins, while its neighbour Afooleh had its residents; on my next visit it
was Fooleh rebuilt, and the other a heap of overthrown stones, or next time
both of them lying in utter silence and desertion.&nbsp; The same with
<i>Mekebleh</i>, sometimes inhabited, but more frequently a pile of
broken-down houses, with some remains of antique sculpture lying on the
surface of its hill; and the same occasionally, though not so frequent in
vicissitude, with <i>Iksal</i>.</p>
<p>From this exposure to invasion of royal armies or of nomad tribes,
(&ldquo;children of the East,&rdquo; Judges vi. 33,) it has always been the
case that no towns were built in the central parts of this plain; and even
when the kings of Israel had their country residence at Jezreel, that
situation was selected because it was nestled close to the hills, and had
ravines on two sides of it, serving as fortifying trenches made by
nature.</p>
<p>At the present time there are no trees upon that broad expanse, not even
olives, to furnish lights for dwelling, either of villages or tents.&nbsp;
The wretched people grow castor-oil plants instead for that purpose, sown
afresh every year, because these afford no temptation to the hostile
Arabs.</p>
<p>That year, however, of 1851, and probably for some time previous, the
plain (Merj ibn Amer is its Arabic name,) had been at peace, unmolested by
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>strangers; consequently I saw large crops of wheat there, and
fields of barley waving in the breeze.&nbsp; These were mostly the property
of a Turkom&acirc;n tribe, who, like the Kenites of old, reside there in
tents, neither building houses nor planting vineyards, though to some
extent they sow seed.&nbsp; They have been long upon that ground, but move
their tents about, according to the exigencies of pasture for their flocks
and herds.&nbsp; I believe, however, that they pay &ldquo;khooweh&rdquo;
(brotherhood,) <i>i.e.</i> tribute and military aid, to the Sukoor Arabs
for protection and peace under common circumstances.</p>
<p>We had frequently to cross small streams issuing from the ranges of
hills, along the base of which our road lay; but they accomplished only
short courses, for they were soon absorbed into the ground or settled into
morasses, which emitted strong miasma under the influence of the sun.&nbsp;
Some petty springs were seen rising from the ground itself, and near each
of these were sure to be met some relics of antiquity, such as good squared
building stones, or door-posts, or broken olive presses, or fragments of
sarcophagi, while the adjacent hills exhibited the hewn lines in the form
of steps, remaining from ancient quarrying.&nbsp; The deep alluvium of the
plain furnishes no stone whatever for such purposes.</p>
<p>In forty minutes from Ta&rsquo;annuk, we came to the small mills of
<i>Lejjoon</i>, (the Roman <i>Legio</i>, named from a military station
there.)&nbsp; At that time of the <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>year the body of
water was not considerable, and there is no village there.</p>
<p>In fifty minutes more we crossed a rivulet named <i>Menzel el Basha</i>,
(the Pasha&rsquo;s halting-place,) and in twenty minutes more, the
<i>&rsquo;Ain Kaimoon</i> with abundance of water.&nbsp; This is at the
foot of a hill which has on its summit the vestiges of the large ancient
town <i>Kaimoon</i>.</p>
<p>This hill is long, narrow, and curved like a cucumber, lying at the
south-east end of Mount Carmel, and having the Kishon river on its outer or
north-eastern side.&nbsp; Here, therefore, we come distinctly upon the
western geography of the Zebulon tribe.&nbsp; In Joshua xix. 11, the border
of Zebulon is given as reaching &ldquo;to the river that is before
Jokneam.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not doubt that this river is the Kishon, or that
Jokneam is the &ldquo;Jokneam of Carmel,&rdquo; in chapter xii. 22, which
was given to the Levites &ldquo;out of the tribe of Zebulon, Jokneam with
her suburbs,&rdquo; (chap. xxi. 34.)&nbsp; This place, Kaimoon or Yokneam,
must have been one of particular value in a military point of view,
commanding as it did the pass of the Kishon valley on one side, and the
<i>Wadi Mel&rsquo;hh</i> on the other.&nbsp; Such a post would be in good
hands, when intrusted to the bold and warlike tribe of Levi.&nbsp; In the
same way several other defensible posts were committed to their charge all
over the country. <a name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230"
class="citation">[230]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>On my present journey I passed round the outer line of Tell
Kaimoon, having Kishon on the right.&nbsp; In so doing we crossed various
tributary streams&mdash;the first one, in quarter of an hour from
&rsquo;Ain Kaimoon, was in <i>Wadi el Kasab</i>, (valley of reeds or
canes)&mdash;the stream was bordered by reeds and a profusion of tall
oleander in gorgeous pink flower.</p>
<p>In this neighbourhood, the Turkom&acirc;ns had commenced reaping their
grain.&nbsp; They are a race of people not to be mistaken for Arabs, men of
strong build, and with a smiling expression on their clear, ruddy
countenances.&nbsp; Besides Arabic, they speak their own coarse dialect of
Turkish&mdash;several of them came running to us with handfuls of wheat
from their harvest.&nbsp; They possess large herds of oxen with good
horses.</p>
<p>In another half hour we were at <i>&rsquo;Ain el Sufs&acirc;feh</i>,
(the &ldquo;fountain of the willow-tree,&rdquo;) where the water issues
from a rock, and in its bed are two willow-trees; upon the bank were plenty
of blackberry bushes.</p>
<p>Just before this we had by the roadside a common looking Arab
burial-place, named <i>Shaikh S&acirc;d</i>; probably from some Mohammedan
devotee of that name interred there; and among the stones about the graves
is a fragment of an ancient cornice, deeply sculptured in the pattern here
shown.</p>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>
<a href="images/p232.jpg">
<img alt="Fragment of Sculpture at Shaikh S&acirc;d" src="images/p232.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour further we passed <i>Wadi Keereh</i>, with its
full stream of water, and plenty of oleander for adornment.</p>
<p>Thence in about half an hour we arrived at <i>Wadi Mel&rsquo;hh</i>
(&ldquo;Salt valley,&rdquo;) with its rivulet and wild holly-oaks, in which
is a great highway leading southwards.&nbsp; This separates the Samaria
ridge and Kaimoon from the extremity of the long Mount Carmel.</p>
<p>Having thus passed from one end to the other along the side of the hill
of Kaimoon, we turned aside from the road, for taking refreshment under a
large oak halfway up that hill, where wild holly-oaks were springing from
the ground to mingle with the sombre yet shining boughs of the tree.&nbsp;
This was at the sudden contraction of the country into a narrow neck
leading to the Plain of Acre.&nbsp; <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>This strait is
bounded on one side by Carmel, and on the other by the Galilean hills, both
sides clothed with abundance of growing timber; and through its midst is
the channel of the Kishon, deeply cut into soft alluvial soil, and this
channel also is bordered with oleander and trees that were enlivened with
doves, thrushes, linnets, and gold-finches.&nbsp; The modern name of the
river is the <i>Mokatta</i> (the ford,) and that of the valley <i>El
Kasab</i>, derived from the spring and valley before-mentioned.</p>
<p>At the narrowest part of this &ldquo;Kasab&rdquo; stands a hill, forming
a serious impediment to the progress of armies, named <i>Tell el Kasees</i>
(Hill of the Priest,) which name may be a traditional remembrance of
Elijah, slaying the priests of Baal; but inasmuch as the word
&ldquo;Kasees&rdquo; is in the singular number, the appellation may be more
likely derived from some hermit residing there in a later age.&nbsp; At any
rate, this Tell lies immediately below the site of that memorable
sacrifice, and at the point where the Kishon sweeps round to the foot of
the mountain a path descends from the &ldquo;Mohhrakah,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
the place of the burnt-offering, to the river.&nbsp; It must therefore,
have been the spot where the priests of Baal were slain, whether the hill
be named from the fact or not; and nothing can be more exact than the words
of the Bible in 1 Kings xviii. 40.</p>
<p>We were preparing to remount for continuing the journey when our guide
espied four wild-looking <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>Arabs walking with long strides up the hill,
so as to pass behind and above us; they were well armed, and made no reply
to our challenge.&nbsp; As our horses and the guide&rsquo;s spear would
have benefited us little on the steep hill-side, but on the contrary were
tempting prizes, and as our fire-arms were not so numerous as theirs, we
thought fit to pace away before they should obtain any further advantage of
situation over us.</p>
<p>In another quarter of an hour we left the straight road to Caiffa, and
struck out northwards, crossing the Kishon at a fort opposite a village on
a hill called <i>El Hharatheeyeh</i>, just before we should otherwise have
come to a low hill covered with a ripe crop of barley, which, from its
formation and other circumstances, bore the appearance of an ancient
fortified place.&nbsp; This hill was named <i>&rsquo;Asfi</i>, as I wrote
it from pronunciation.&nbsp; This, with the <i>Hharatheeyeh</i>, one
assisting the other, would prove a good military defence at this end of the
valley, as Kaimoon and the Kasees were at the other.</p>
<p>Dr Thomson, in his &ldquo;Land and the Book,&rdquo; chap. xxxi.,
considers this site to be that of &ldquo;Harosheth of the Gentiles,&rdquo;
(Judges iv. 13,) and I have no doubt that his supposition is correct; the
topography agrees, and the etymology in both Hebrew and Arabic is one,
viz., &ldquo;ploughed land.&rdquo;&nbsp; This author, however, makes no
mention of <i>&rsquo;Asfi</i> though he speaks of &ldquo;the double
Tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether &rsquo;Asfi was an aboriginal home of the <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>people in the modern
<i>Esfia</i> on the summit of Carmel, I have no means of knowing; but that
a population, when emigrating to a new settlement, sometimes carried their
name with them, appears in Scripture in the instance of Luz, (Judges i.
26,) and of Dan in the 19th chapter.</p>
<p>Previous to this day&rsquo;s journey I had no adequate idea of the
quantity of water that could be poured into the Kishon channel by the
affluents above-mentioned, (since our passing the Lejjoon stream which runs
in an opposite direction,) namely, the Menzel el Basha, the &rsquo;Ain
Sufs&acirc;feh, Wadi Keereh, and Wadi Mel&rsquo;hh, all these on the Carmel
side of the river, and omitting the more important spring called
<i>Sa&rsquo;adeh</i>, near <i>Beled esh Shaikh</i>, on the way to
Caiffa.</p>
<p>Still portions of the channel are liable to be dried up in that
direction, although the bed extending to Jeneen if not to Gilboa contains
springs from the ground at intervals, but the level character of the
country and the softness of the ground are unfavourable to the existence of
a free river course.&nbsp; There was but little water at Hharatheeyeh when
we crossed in the month of May.&nbsp; The &rsquo;Ain Sa&rsquo;adeh,
however, which I did not then visit, never fails, and in full season, the
Kishon near the sea becomes a formidable river, as I have more than once
found.</p>
<p>To return to the valley &ldquo;El Kasab,&rdquo; we were assured that in
winter time the whole breadth <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>is sometimes inundated, and even after this
has subsided, the alluvial soil is dangerous for attempting to travel in,
it becomes a bog for animals of burden.&nbsp; Thus it is quite conceivable
that at the occurrence of a mighty storm, divinely and specially
commissioned to destroy, the host of Sisera and his chariots would be
irretrievably discomfited.</p>
<p>Where the scene opened upon the plain of Acre there was extensive
cultivation visible, and the town of Caiffa appeared with the grove of
palm-trees in its vicinity.</p>
<p>The view hence of the Caiffa bay reminds us of the prophetic blessing
pronounced by the patriarch Jacob.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zebulon shall dwell at the
<i>haven</i> of the sea, and he shall be for a haven of ships.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I am convinced that this Hebrew root &#1508;&#1493;&#1495; (English
<i>haven</i> and the German <i>hafen</i>) is perpetuated not only in those
words but in the modern appellation, Caiffa, or as it may be more properly
written <i>Hhaifa</i>.&nbsp; The Arabic letter &#1581; is the real
equivalent for &#1495; in Hebrew; by grammatical permutation the letter
&#1493; rightly becomes &#1610; in Arabic, and this we have </p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p236.jpg">
<img alt="Arabic word" src="images/p236.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Hhaifa which Europeans turn into Caiffa.</p>
<p>We then reached a low natural mound on which are ruined walls of great
thickness, the levelled surface on the summit had been probably all
occupied by one castle with its outworks, but we saw it yellow with a ripe
crop of barley.&nbsp; This place is <i>Hurbaj</i>, and the neighbourhood
abounds with destroyed villages, the natural consequence of <!-- page
237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>being so
near to Acre, and being the <i>pal&oelig;stra</i> or wrestling ground of
great nations in successive ages.</p>
<p>We arrived at Acre in exactly twelve hours from Jeneen, and pitched the
tents outside upon a bank between two trenches of the fortification,
commanding extensive views in every direction, and were fanned by sea
breezes from the bay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I may observe that the plain called by the Greeks
<i>Esdraelon</i>, as a corruption of Jezreel, is that named
&ldquo;Megiddo&rdquo; in Old Testament Scripture.&nbsp; In the New
Testament it bears the prefix of the Hebrew word <i>Har</i> (mountain)
minus the aspirate, being written in Greek, and so becomes
&ldquo;Armageddon&rdquo; in the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>For topographical reasons it is very likely that the city of Megiddo was
at Lejjoon.&nbsp; There is a village of <i>Mujaidel</i> on the north side
of the plain, not far from Nazareth, but this is a diminutive of the Arabic
<i>Mejdal</i>, so common in Palestine as a variation from the Hebrew
Migdol.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Besides the above journey I made an excursion in 1859 on the summit of
Carmel itself.</p>
<p>Leaving the Convent, which is at the western termination of the
mountain, we proceeded along the top of its main ridge to the opposite
extremity, the <i>Mohhrakah</i>, undoubtedly the locality of Elijah&rsquo;s
miraculous sacrifice in presence of King Ahab with the priests of Baal and
of the groves; thence we <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>returned to encamp for a time at the cleanly
Druse village of <i>&rsquo;Esfia</i>; after which a few hours&rsquo; ride
westwards led us by the village of <i>D&acirc;liet el Carmel</i>, <a
name="citation238"></a><a href="#footnote238" class="citation">[238]</a>
also inhabited by Druses, to the romantic <i>&rsquo;Ain ez
Zera&rsquo;ah</i> and over the sites of ruined places, <i>Doomeen</i>,
<i>Shel&acirc;leh</i>, and <i>Lubieh</i>, where the hewn stones lying
scattered over the ground were indications of much better buildings than
those of modern villages.</p>
<p>Then down the long and wearisome descent to <i>Teeri</i> on the
sea-coast south of Caiffa.</p>
<p>For topographical purposes chiefly, let me give an outline of a few
other journeys made about the same neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>1.&nbsp; FROM SAFED TO CARMEL.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sept.</i> 1846.</p>
<p>Going in the direction of the sea, that is, from Naphtali downwards into
Zebulon, we crossed westwards the <i>Jebel Rama</i>, a long hilly range
ending in the south at Rama, and richly wooded, but to our surprise there
were numerous fires left by the people to consume trees and large shrubs at
discretion, for the making of charcoal.&nbsp; Fortunately for us there was
no wind blowing, but several times as <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>the fiery ashes had
been drifted upon the road, our horses had no choice but to step into
them.&nbsp; On that eminence I picked up specimens of Geodes which abound
there, being lumps resembling fruits outside, but when broken found to be a
crust of bright spar, and hollow in the centre; some of these were
remarkably large.&nbsp; The hills were fragrant with wild herbs, and the
views from them delightful.</p>
<p>After <i>Semwan</i> we strayed from the right road and got to
<i>Shemu&acirc;ta</i>, where we procured a guide to conduct us in the
direction of Carmel; he undertook to conduct us as far as <i>Abu
&rsquo;Atabeh</i>, from which Carmel would be visible, and the distance
equal either to Acre or to Caiffa.&nbsp; From the heights we descended to
<i>Ekwik&acirc;t</i>, and there found ourselves too tired to get further
that night.</p>
<p>In the morning we passed the <i>Bahhjah</i>, which had been the
luxurious summer residence of Abdallah Pasha, but was in a ruinous
condition, and came to <i>Abu &rsquo;Atabeh</i>, which is not a village but
a collection of a few houses, perhaps formerly some outlying dwellings
belonging to the Bahhjah.&nbsp; Here was a fountain, and a small aqueduct
for conveying water to gardens.</p>
<p>Crossed the <i>Naam&agrave;n</i> river, anciently named the
<i>Belus</i>, on the banks of which, according to Pliny, the primitive idea
of glass-making was discovered by accident.&nbsp; Along the beach we came
to the Mokatta&rsquo; or Kishon, found it deep for fording, but <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>got over to
Caiffa, and mounted to the Convent of Carmel.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; NAZARETH TOWARDS ACRE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Oct.</i> 1849.</p>
<p>Passing <i>Sefoorieh</i>, (the Sepphoris so often mentioned in Josephus)
with a distant view of Carmel on the left, like a huge rampart of dark
blue, we came to the ruined Khan with a fountain called the <i>&rsquo;Ain
el Bedaweeyeh</i>, then through delightful wooded glades, on issuing from
which we saw <i>Shefa &rsquo;Amer</i>, a handsome-looking place, with which
I made better acquaintance in after years.</p>
<p>On the plain of Acre I picked up a cannon ball, probably a twelve
pounder.</p>
<p>(This journey was repeated in March 1852, and in March 1859.)</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp; FROM TIBERIAS TO ACRE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 1850.</p>
<p>From <i>Hhatteen</i> to <i>&rsquo;Eilaboon</i>, a quiet and pretty
village, after which we had a long stretch of &ldquo;merrie
greenwood&rdquo; with furze in golden blossom, birds singing, and the
clucking of partridges.&nbsp; At one place where the old trees echoed the
shouts of country children at their sports, there rose above the summits a
bold round tower, which on nearer approach we found to be an outwork of the
fortification of a venerable convent called <i>Dair Hhanna</i>, which in
comparatively recent times had been converted into a castle, but convent,
castle, and tower are now become a picturesque ruin.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Near this we saw squatted on the ground a family of three
generations, almost entirely naked; they had a fire lighted, and the women
were washing clothes in the water heated by it, a great rarity in
Palestine, for they usually wash with cold water at the spring.&nbsp; Some
Met&acirc;waleh peasants ran away from our party when we wished to make
some inquiries of them.</p>
<p>From an eminence we saw before us a flat plain inundated like a lake,
left by the wintry floods.&nbsp; This occurs there yearly around the
flourishing village of <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;bet el Battoof</i>, at which we
soon arrived, after which we galloped for miles over green pastures of
grass interspersed by trees.</p>
<p>In three quarters of an hour further we came to <i>Sukhneen</i>, a large
village with good cultivation extending far around.&nbsp; Still traversing
green undulations with wooded hills to the right and left, in another hour
we were at a small place called <i>Ne&acirc;b</i>, where the scenery
suddenly changed for stony hills and valleys.&nbsp; In a little short of
another hour we saw <i>Damooneh</i> at half an hour&rsquo;s distance to the
left.&nbsp; In twenty minutes more we stopped to drink at the well
<i>Berweh</i>, then pressed forward in haste to arrive at Acre before the
gates (being a fortification) should be closed.&nbsp; We got there in fifty
minutes&rsquo; hard riding from <i>&rsquo;Ain Berweh</i>.</p>

242</span>II.&nbsp; THE REVERSE WAY FROM WEST TO EAST.</h2>
<h3>1.&nbsp; ACRE TO TIBERIAS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 1850.</p>
<p>Crossed the river Naam&acirc;n, and paced slowly over the extensive
marshes, making for <i>Shefa &rsquo;Amer</i>.</p>
<p>Among these marshes was a herd of about two hundred horses at free
pasture upon the grass, weeds, and rushes, so succulent at that season of
the year; these were on their way from Northern Syria, and were intended
for sale.</p>
<p>Also among the marshes was a temporary village of tabernacles or huts
made of plaited palm-leaves, and papyrus canes or reeds, such as one sees
on the line of the Jordan or about the lake Hhooleh, with the same class of
proprietors in both cases, the Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs.&nbsp; Strange that
this race of human beings should prefer to inhabit feverish marshes.</p>
<p>We came upon a paved causeway (called the <i>Resheef</i>) leading from a
large mill towards the sea, but only the portion nearest to the mill now
remains entire.&nbsp; Probably this was turned to some account during the
French military operations against Acre in 1799.</p>
<p>At Shefa &rsquo;Amer we had <i>&rsquo;Ebeleen</i> in sight.&nbsp; Both
places are conspicuous over the district around.&nbsp; At some distance
from the town is a large well for its supply, and along the broad road
between the well and the town, the Druse women are <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>constantly passing
with their horns over the forehead and their jars on the shoulders.</p>
<p>Shefa &rsquo;Amer is crowned by the remains of the Palace Castle erected
by Shaikh Daher, (celebrated in Volney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Syria,&rdquo;) and
the shell of a large old Christian church; near these are some very ancient
wells cut into solid rock, but now containing no water.</p>
<p>The majority of the inhabitants are Druses.&nbsp; There are a few
Moslems and a few Christians; but at that time there were thirty Jewish
families living as agriculturists, cultivating grain and olives on their
own landed property, most of it family inheritance; some of these people
were of Algerine descent.&nbsp; They had their own synagogue and legally
qualified butcher, and their numbers had formerly been more considerable.
<a name="citation243"></a><a href="#footnote243"
class="citation">[243]</a></p>
<p>I felt an especial interest in these people, as well as in the knowledge
of a similar community existing at a small village not far distant named
<i>Bokea&rsquo;h</i>.</p>
<p>Upon the road that day, and in half an hour from the town, I met a
couple of rosy-faced, strong peasant men, with sparkling Jewish eyes, who
set to speaking Hebrew with some Rabbis in my company.&nbsp; It was in a
scene of woodland and cornfields under the blue canopy of heaven; their
costume was that of the ordinary Met&acirc;waleh <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>peasantry,
<i>i.e.</i>, a scarlet and embroidered short coat with large dark blue
trousers.&nbsp; I shall never forget this circumstance, of finding men of
Israel, fresh from agricultural labour, conversing in Hebrew in their own
land.</p>
<p>Our road then led through glades of exceeding beauty: an English park
backed by mountains in a Syrian climate.&nbsp; The gently undulating land
was clothed with rich grass, and sprinkled (not thronged) with timber,
chiefly terebinth.&nbsp; Linnets and thrushes were warbling among the
trees.</p>
<p><i>Cuf&rsquo;r Menda</i> was on our left; <i>Sefoorieh</i> at a distance
on the right; <i>Rum&acirc;neh</i> and <i>&rsquo;Azair</i> before us.&nbsp;
Then we entered upon the long plain of <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;bet el
Battoof</i>, and rested a short time before sunset at <i>&rsquo;Ain
Bedaweeyeh</i> for refreshment.&nbsp; Carpets were spread upon long grass
which sank under the pressure.&nbsp; The horses and mules were set free to
pasture, and we formed ourselves into separate eating groups; one
Christian, one Jewish, and one Moslem.&nbsp; Some storks were likewise
feeding in a neighbouring bean-field, the fragrance of which was delicious,
as wafted to us by the evening breeze.</p>
<p>On remounting for the road to Tiberias, several hours beyond, we put on
cloaks to keep off the falling dew, and paced on by a beautiful moonlight,
at first dimmed by mist or dew, which afterwards disappeared; the spear
carried by one of the party glimmered as we went on; and the Jews whiled
away the time by recitation of their <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>evening prayers on
horseback, and conversing in the Hebrew language about their warrior
forefathers of Galilee.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; CAIFFA TO NAZARETH.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>July</i> 1854.</p>
<p>Passing through the rush of <i>&rsquo;Ain Saadeh</i> water as it tumbles
from the rocky base of Carmel, and by the <i>Beled esh Shaikh</i> and
<i>Yajoor</i>, we crossed the Kishon bed to take a road new to me, namely,
by <i>Damooneh</i>, leaving <i>Mujaidel</i> and <i>Yafah</i> visible on our
right, upon the crests of hills overlooking the Plain of Esdraelon.&nbsp;
We passed through a good deal of greenwood scenery, so refreshing in the
month of July, but on the whole not equal in beauty to the road by Shefa
&rsquo;Amer.</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp; CAIFFA TO NAZARETH.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sept.</i> 1857.</p>
<p>By <i>Beled esh Shaikh</i> and <i>Yajoor</i>, where threshing of the
harvest was in progress in the Galilean fashion by means of the
<i>moraj</i>, (in Hebrew the <i>morag</i>, Isa. xli.&nbsp; 15 and 2 Sam.
xxiv. 22,) which is a stout board of wood, with iron teeth or flints on the
under surface.&nbsp; The plank turns upward in front, and the man or boy
stands upon it in exactly the attitude of a Grecian charioteer: one foot
advanced; the head and chest well thrown back; the reins in his left hand,
and with a long thonged whip, he drives the horses that are attached to it
at a rapid pace in a circle, shouting merrily or singing as they
go,&mdash;a totally different operation from the drowsy <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>creeping of the oxen
or other animals for threshing in our Southern Palestine.</p>
<p>In due time we crossed the bed of the Kishon, which was quite dry in
that part above the <i>Sa&rsquo;adeh</i>, except where some green stagnant
puddles occurred at intervals.</p>
<p>We passed a herd of camels belonging to the Turkomans, walking
unburdened, whereas all other animals that we met were laden with grain for
the port of Caiffa.&nbsp; At the commencement of the ascent on the opposite
hills we rested under the <i>Tell el Hharatheeyeh</i>, beneath a noble tree
of the evergreen oak; and near there we passed alongside of a camp of
degraded Arabs called <i>Beramki</i>, in a few tattered tents, but they had
some capital horses picketed around them.&nbsp; The villagers regard these
people with ineffable disdain, as &ldquo;cousins of the
gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems that they subsist by singing songs among
real Arab camps, and by letting out their horses as stallions for breeding,
with variations of picking and stealing.&nbsp; We saw some of their women
and children, filthy in person, painfully employed in scraping away the
ground wherever black clay showed itself, in the hope of reaching water,
however bad in quality.</p>
<p>There was threshing at <i>Jaida</i> as we passed that village.&nbsp; We
halted at the spring of <i>Samooniah</i>, and at <i>Ma&rsquo;alool</i>; the
priest of the village was superintending the parish threshing: his
reverence was covered with dust from the operation.</p>
<h3><!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>4.&nbsp; CAIFFA TO SHEFA &rsquo;AMER.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 1859.</p>
<p>From <i>Beled esh Shaikh</i> and <i>Yajoor</i>, across the Kishon
channel, upon the plain of Acre, and rested a short time at the <i>Weli of
Jedro</i>, (very like a Hebrew name,) and then near us, all close together
were the three villages of <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Ita</i>, <i>Ja&rsquo;arah</i> and
<i>Hurbaj</i>.&nbsp; Thence to Shefa &rsquo;Amer, first diverging somewhat
to <i>&rsquo;Ebeleen</i>.</p>
<h2>III.&nbsp; SOUTH SIDE OF ESDRAELON.</h2>
<h3>1.&nbsp; PLAIN OF SHARON TO CAIFFA.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Oct.</i> 1849.</p>
<p>At <i>Baka</i> we leave the plain of Sharon, at its northern end, if
indeed the extensive level from the Egyptian desert up to this point, may
come under this one denomination; and we enter upon the hilly woodlands of
Ephraim and Manasseh, so clearly described in Joshua xvii. 11, 17, 18.</p>
<p>In mounting to the higher ground, there is obtained a fine view of the
sea, and the oak and karoobah trees were larger as we advanced; from
certain stations we obtained a totally unexpected prospect of a stretch of
large forest scenery below us, extending towards <i>Sindianeh</i> in the
west.</p>
<p>At one spot we passed among scattered stones of excellent masonry, large
and rabbeted at the edges, lying confusedly about, enough for a small town,
but evidently belonging to a period of <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>ancient date; a few
mud huts were adjoining these.</p>
<p>Thence we descended into a long valley, several miles in extent, called
<i>Wadi &rsquo;Arah</i>, fully occupied with cotton crops, and stubble of
the last harvest of grain.&nbsp; The valley was bounded on either side by
well timbered hills, and its direction was N.E. by E.</p>
<p>After an hour in this long enclosure, the pleasing features of the scene
became less defined in character, and, uncertain of our way, we climbed up
to a village called <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;rah</i>, where, after an
hour&rsquo;s trouble, we got a guide at high price for the rest of the
day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The evening was then advancing, and the gnats
from the trees and shrubs plagued the horses.&nbsp; Among these trees were
grand old oaks of a kind that bear gigantic acorns with mossy cups.&nbsp;
At length the verdure ceased, and we had only stony hills.&nbsp; There was,
however, a weli with a spring of water, and fruit trees by the roadside,
crowded with a shoal of singing birds all rustling and chirping at once
among the boughs as the sun was setting, and throwing a glorious red over
the clouds which had been gradually collecting during the afternoon.</p>
<p>We left the village of <i>Umm el Fahh&rsquo;m</i>, (&ldquo;Mother of
Charcoal&rdquo;&mdash;a name significant of a woodland district) upon the
right, and night closed in; our old guide on his little donkey singing
cheerily in front, till darkness reduced us all to silence.</p>
<p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>We crossed the small rivulet at <i>Lejjoon</i> by starlight; and
the rest of the journey in the night was not only monotonous, but even
dangerous, over marshes and chinks in the Plain of Esdraelon.&nbsp; Our
course was in a direction N.E. to Nazareth, which we reached in sixteen
hours from the morning&rsquo;s starting at <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Saba</i>.</p>
<p>There were fortunately no roaming Arabs to molest us in this night
passage across the <i>Merj ibn &rsquo;Amer</i>.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; PLAIN OF SHARON TO CAIFFA.</h3>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 1859.</p>
<p>As before, we left the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon, but
this time at the eastern and minor village of <i>Baka</i>, and thus we
missed the ruined town before noticed, but got into the same valley of
<i>&rsquo;Arah</i>; and in the great heat of summer, confined between the
two ridges of hills, we crept on to the extremity of the valley, and
mounted a hill to the village of <i>Mushmusheh</i>, opposite to <i>Umm el
Fahh&rsquo;m</i>.&nbsp; All the villages in that region are situated on
hills, and are of no easy access.</p>
<p>This place enjoys abundance of water springing out of the ground, and at
any risk so precious a treasure ought not to be lost; therefore, although
the houses were abandoned and the people scattered, they come there
stealthily, and as opportunity arises, to do the little service to the
ground that it required, and watch its oranges, lemons, and pomegranates,
(from the name it would seem that <!-- page 250--><a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>formerly this place
was famous for apricots.)&nbsp; As we halted and pitched tents there, one
by one some of the people came about us, although they had been preparing
to leave for the night, in order to sleep at &ldquo;Charcoal&rsquo;s
Mother,&rdquo; (the village opposite.)&nbsp; They stayed under our
protection, and got for us certain supplies from over the way.</p>
<p>Close beside us was a gigantic mulberry tree, around which two very
large vines climbed to a great height, and a channel of running water
almost surrounded the roots.</p>
<p>I never heard such sweet-toned bells as the flocks about there carried,
and which gave out their music near and far at every movement of the goats
and sheep.</p>
<p>In the morning we left this very pleasant spot and went on to
<i>Lejjoon</i>; crossed the Sufs&acirc;feh and the other streams with their
oleander borders, and enjoyed the magnificent prospects of Hermon, Tabor,
and the plain; rested on the hill of <i>Kaimoon</i> under the fine oak-tree
of former acquaintance, and at length arrived in Caiffa.</p>
<h2>IV.&nbsp; FROM CARMEL SOUTH-EASTWARDS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>April</i> 1859.</p>
<p>The usual way by <i>&rsquo;Ain Sa&rsquo;adeh</i>, <i>Beled esh
Shaikh</i> and <i>Yajoor</i>; the woody sides of Carmel diversified in
colour at this season of spring; there was the dark green of the bellota
oak, the yellow of the abundant broom, the dark red-brown of the <!-- page
251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>sprouting
terebinth and the pale green of young-leafed trees of many other
kinds.&nbsp; There was, moreover, the fragrance of an occasional pine, and
of the hawthorn, (Za&rsquo;aroor,) which is of stronger scent than in
England; and the ground was sprinkled with purple and yellow crocuses; also
with anemones of every shade of purple and white, besides the scarlet,
which alone are found in Jud&aelig;a, but there in profusion.</p>
<p>Turning off from the road to Jeneen, I rose upon high ground, and came
to <i>Umm ez Zeen&acirc;t</i>, (mother of beauties.)&nbsp; Our people were
of opinion that this name did not apply so much to the daughters of the
village as to the landscape scenery, for near it we commanded an extensive
prospect, including Hermon with its snows one way, and the &ldquo;great and
wide sea&rdquo; in the opposite quarter.</p>
<p>We lost our way for a time, leaving <i>Rehhaneeyeh</i> on our left, and
straying as far as <i>D&acirc;liet er Rohha</i>; on recovering the right
road we arrived at <i>Cuferain</i>, (the &ldquo;double village&rdquo;) and
to <i>Umm el Fahh&rsquo;m</i>, marching among silent woods often tangled by
neglected growth, and abounding in a variety of unknown trees, besides the
Seringa and the oaks with much broader leaves than are ever seen in the
south; also, for a long period we had frequent recurring views of snowy
Hermon in the N.E.</p>
<p>The considerable village of <i>&rsquo;Aneen</i> we found almost entirely
broken up, by the recent warfare between the partisans of Tokan and
&rsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l Hadi.&nbsp; <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>At length our repeated calls and promises
echoing among the apparently forsaken houses, brought out an old man, and
he promised to procure a guide to take us within sight of
<i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh</i>, after which several women peered out of their
miserable dwellings.</p>
<p>The guide conducted us through large woods on heights and in depths,
among fragrant herbs and blossoming trees growing wild, till some time
after sunset, when we stopped for the night at a poor village called
<i>Harakat</i>; we were all tired, but especially the two women of a
Christian party going to Jerusalem, who had attached themselves to us all
the day for the benefit of our protection.</p>
<p>The ground on which the tent was set up was wet, as there had been some
rain at the place that day, and springs of water were running to waste near
us; the village people served as guards around us, on being fed at our
expense; the pilgrims spread their beds in one direction outside the tent,
and the kaww&acirc;ses in the opposite.</p>
<p>By the light of a brilliant morning we marched forwards to
<i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh</i>, which was being besieged by the Turkish
government, in force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery.</p>
<h2><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>VIII.&nbsp; BEL&Acirc;D BESH&Acirc;RAH.</h2>
<p>This is the mountainous district lying east and south of Tyre, probably
the &ldquo;Galilee of the Gentiles;&rdquo; bounded on the north by the
river <i>Kasim&icirc;yeh</i>, the ancient Leontes; on the west by the plain
of Tyre; on the east by the plain of Hhooleh and of the Upper Jordan; on
the south by hills around Safed: the district is very little known to
Europeans, and was much less so in 1848.</p>
<p>In that year I entered it from the North, after traversing the Sidon
country, crossing the pleasant river with its rose-coloured border of
oleander and wild holly-oak at a ford wider than the average breadth of the
Jordan.</p>
<p>There we found abundance of noble trees, and some cottages near them,
the vines belonging to which climbed up those trees to a surprising height;
and the thickness of the vines exceeded any that I had any where or at any
time seen.</p>
<p>In front was the village of <i>Boorj</i>, and we mounted into a high
table-land commanding prospects of <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>indescribable
grandeur, which comprised parts of both Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, the
extreme heights of Sannin and Hermon being visible at once.</p>
<p>The day was one of hot shirocco, and there were fires of lime-kilns
visible in several directions, this season (late in autumn) being that
appropriated to such employment, after all the harvests are gathered
in.</p>
<p>There were innumerable villages appearing in every direction.&nbsp; We
passed <i>Ab&acirc;siyeh</i> on our right; <i>Dar Meemas</i> and
<i>Izereiriyeh</i> distant on the left; <i>Tura</i> on the right; <i>Dar
Kanoon</i> we almost entered; <i>Bidias</i> near us on the left; <i>Dair
Thecla</i> on our right; <i>Bursheen</i> on the right; <i>Durtghayer</i> on
the left; <i>Arzoon</i> further on the left; then we rested under some
olive trees, with <i>Dar esh Shems</i> on the right; <i>Mezra&rsquo;a</i>
on the left; <i>Dar Zibneh</i> with a castle on our right.</p>
<p>In the distance appeared the mighty old castle of <i>Shukeef</i>
(<i>Belfort</i> of the Crusaders) upon an eminence, with Jebel esh Shaikh,
or Hermon, rising majestically behind it.</p>
<p>As we descended into a deep glen between verdant hills, the partridges
were clucking in multitudes, and so unaccustomed to intrusion, that
sometimes they came running up towards us; magpies were flying about, and
we were told that the glen abounds in wild beasts, which there seemed no
reason to doubt.&nbsp; For hours we wound round <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>and round within this
cool and refreshing labyrinth of arbutus, bellota or evergreen oak, aspen,
clematis, broom, and what looked like the sloe, besides other and unknown
vegetation.&nbsp; The bellota was often respectable-sized timber in girth,
though of no considerable height; sometimes our path was overshadowed by
their branches stretching across, and we had to stoop beneath them.&nbsp;
On the sides of the hills were many fires of the charcoal burners.</p>
<p>As evening came on, we could see our lofty green prison walls tipped
with the setting sun.</p>
<p>At length the glen seemed to be terminated by a fine round hill, crowned
with a village standing across the passage.&nbsp; The appearance improved
as we drew nearer; inhabitants were not few; large flocks and herds were
winding by several ways towards it.&nbsp; The people named it <i>Khirbet
Sellim</i>, (Sellim in ruin) but how could all this cheerful scene belong
to a ruin?</p>
<p>The sun set and we had another hour of the lovely glen to thread by
starlight.&nbsp; At last we emerged by a gently inclined plain, which
gradually became rougher, and we mounted the steep hill on which
<i>Tibneen</i> is built.&nbsp; There we determined to halt for the night,
as our cattle were unable to hold on to <i>Bint el Jebail</i>.</p>
<p>We pitched on the threshing floor between the village and the
castle.</p>
<p>This castle is the citadel of all the Bel&acirc;d Besh&acirc;rah, <!--
page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>from
the Leontes to Safed, and Ahhmad Bek, its owner, is called by his people
&ldquo;the Shaikh of Shaikhs;&rdquo; by the Turkish government he is
recognised as Kaimakam of the province.</p>
<p>The people were of ill behaviour, and talked about quarantine, but the
population of the district are at all times a churlish race, being of the
Sheah or &rsquo;Ali sect of Moslems; they curse and loathe our Mohammedans,
and oppress the sparse families of Christians within their reach.&nbsp;
They are called the Mut&acirc;waleh.</p>
<p>At first they refused to let us have anything, till the governor, on
ascertaining who we were, sent us down some lemonade; still we got but few
articles of food, and our horses were left without water.</p>
<p>My kaww&acirc;s Salim was then taken ill from the effect of having slept
the preceding night with his head uncovered, and with reluctance our own
people put up the small tent that travelled with us, on purpose for them;
they always prefer sleeping in open air, only covering the head well with
the cloak.</p>
<p>This was Saturday night, and we had not an agreeable prospect for a
Sabbath rest on the morrow.</p>
<p>The wind was strong all night on that lofty situation, but there was no
dew.</p>
<p>In the morning, the people would not supply us with milk, even for the
horses, and so it was impossible to stay there; we marched on towards <!--
page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Bint el
Jebail, about three hours&rsquo; distant, a considerable place, which often
contests with Tibneen for supremacy in the local government, and where the
governor is a distant relative of him at Tibneen.</p>
<p>From the tents, before starting, we could see the following villages in
a curved line from S.E. to N:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haddata or Haita ez-Zoot.<br />
Bait U&rsquo;oon.<br />
Berasheet.<br />
Hhooleh.<br />
Shakrah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they told us of <i>El Yehudiyeh</i> on the N.W. behind the
castle.&nbsp; The Mediterranean in sight [I became better acquainted with
Tibneen, and on better relations with the people in after years.]</p>
<p>Passed on through a pretty country, like all the Bel&acirc;d
Besh&acirc;rah, with numerous villages in sight; excellent beaten roads,
and plenty of them; with everywhere the magnificent objects in view of
Mount Hermon, and part of the Lebanon, but not always the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Rested at half-way of our short journey under a large evergreen oak on
the summit of a rising ground, with a refreshing breeze blowing; thence
descended to a plain where there were about a dozen wells, and people
drawing water for large herds of neat cattle.&nbsp; Here our horses got
drink.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Bint el Jebail</i>, a nice-looking place, with a
commanding house for the governor, (Hhusain Sulim&acirc;n,) but the people
were at first <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>even more inhospitable than those at Tibneen,
for they drove away our man Khaleel from the village fountain, and covered
up their mouths and noses, in fear of cholera.</p>
<p>On application to the Bek, we got permission to draw water for
ourselves, and he allowed us eggs and bread, with barley for the horses,
and it was with difficulty they accepted any money in return.</p>
<p>The Bek also invited me to visit him in his house, but stipulating not
to shake hands.</p>
<p>On coming near the Serai, (governor&rsquo;s house,) the ladies of the
Hhareem were looking out of the lattices upon the cavalcade.&nbsp; A crowd
of servants were at the door to receive us, in attendance on one of his
sons, who had a large hunting-hawk upon his wrist; silver bells upon her
legs.</p>
<p>We were shown into a large baronial-looking hall, and chairs were placed
for us upon the divan.</p>
<p>The great man sat in the right-hand corner, upon a panther skin, one of
the prey of the country, his brother at his right hand, and his sons ranged
on his left.&nbsp; He wore a robe of the true Moslem apple-green, with a
Cashmere shawl round his waist, and another on his turban.&nbsp; His
countenance and deportment were truly aristocratic; he and all his family
were handsome, with intelligent expression of countenance.</p>
<p>The son who had been outside came in, and put his hawk upon her perch,
then took his place.&nbsp; They gave us sherbet, coffee, and abundant <!--

259</span>compliments: we talked of hawking in England, and English ladies
riding to the sport.&nbsp; London, and the Queen on the throne were
discussed; also Jerusalem, where the Bek had never been.&nbsp; On the whole
the reception was satisfactory.&nbsp; Pity that the people were afraid of
cholera; they did not exhibit the virtue of resignation to Divine
predestination any more than our Sooni-Moslems of the south had done.</p>
<p>Our tents were in a sunny situation, but still we had in them a rest for
Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>At sunset the Bek sent me a present of grapes, those that were purple
were of large size.</p>
<p>Starlight night, but no dew; jackals were howling in troops, sometimes
very close to us.&nbsp; An armed nominal quarantine was placed over us
during the night&mdash;ridiculous enough after a pretty free intercourse of
the people all day.</p>
<p>The morning very cool.&nbsp; A poor Maronite priest from &rsquo;Ain
Nebel came to me in his black robes and dark blue turban, and, leaning on
his staff, gave a lamentable account of persecutions suffered by the four
or five Christian villages about there, and imploring English help on their
behalf.&nbsp; Alas! nothing could be done for him, only the case of the
servant of the governor of Tibneen shooting a poor Christian, while on
compulsory work at the lime-kilns, got inquiry made into it at
Bayroot.&nbsp; On asking his name, and writing it down, the miserable man
said to the secretary, &ldquo;Tell the consul <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>that I have already
written his name on my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto our journey had been entirely novel&mdash;there is no record
published of any traveller passing through that country, from the Leontes,
its northern boundary, before that date.&nbsp; Going forwards, we passed
through pretty green lanes along the sides of hills.&nbsp; From the crest
of a hill, whence the view was very extensive, we had <i>Yaroon</i> on the
right, and beyond it the ruined convent of St George.&nbsp; I afterwards
learned that the church there exhibits proof of great size and
magnificence.</p>
<p>By the roadside was a huge undecorated sarcophagus, in excellent
preservation, standing on a raised platform of masonry; single and alone in
a wide expanse, no village or remnant of human works near it.&nbsp; The
masonry in front had been wilfully damaged, enough to make the sarcophagus
lean, but not to fall, and the ponderous cover was removed from its
place&mdash;total length, eight feet by five, and four in height, the
hollow cut out from the body left the thickness of a foot all round
it.&nbsp; No inscription gives any record of the doubtless important
personage for whom it was prepared, and no embellishments even provide a
clue to the period to which it belongs.&nbsp; It stands well-preserved,
great in its simplicity and position.</p>
<p>Villages of <i>F&acirc;rah</i> and <i>Salchah</i> on our left.</p>
<p>Thence we descended into a glen of blazing <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>white stone, without
any verdure, in which were a diversity of paths, and a petty runlet of
water issuing from the ground, but soon showing only stagnant green pools
and mud, with frogs in abundance, then evaporated altogether.&nbsp; Near
this, Salim was taken with vomiting and purging, and was hardly able to
remain on his horse; the dragoman also fainting and giddy, and the rest
frightened with the terrors of expected cholera.&nbsp; Our guide wanted to
desert us and return home.</p>
<p>The muleteers and luggage had taken another road, but after a time we
met again.&nbsp; Moving on, the ground became a gradual rise, and a stream
coming down it toward us, became clearer as we ascended, and fruit-trees
were rather numerous.</p>
<p>Under some fig-trees the kaww&acirc;s laid himself down, and we stayed
there three hours with him; water was poured over his head to obviate
fever, and I administered some pills.</p>
<p>During the interval I found some sculptured stones with Hebrew
inscriptions, which I have elsewhere described, and took pains to decipher
the words, but without much result.&nbsp; They were lying in a ploughed
field by the roadside.&nbsp; We were now entering on classic ground of the
Talmudists, and upon a precipice above us, upon wide table-ground, was the
village of <i>Jish</i>, the Giscala of Josephus.</p>
<p>When evening brought coolness, we proceeded towards Safed.</p>
<p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>A peasant passing us was carrying home his plough upon his
shoulder, except the iron share, which his little daughter, of two or three
years old, carried on her head.</p>
<p>Some of our horses were so stung by flies that the blood flowed to the
stones under their feet as they went along.</p>
<p>There were traces of ancient pavement along the road, and cavern holes
in chalk-rock sides.&nbsp; Then traversing a few miles of dark volcanic
stone we neared a crater in the ground, whose gloomy aspect was fully in
keeping with the destruction which such a phenomenon bespeaks as having
occurred&mdash;silent as the death it produced, and void of all pleasurable
features, of wild flowers, or even the thorns of nature.</p>
<p>The whole vicinity bore traces of the earthquakes that have often
occurred there, especially that of 1837.</p>
<p>After this a glorious prospect burst upon us of Safed, &ldquo;set upon a
hill,&rdquo; and the gloomy hill of Jarmuk beside it.&nbsp; Tabor also in
view far in advance, throwing a vast shadow of late afternoon-time over
other hills, and glimpses of the lake Tiberias.</p>
<p>Encamped on our former site among the great old olive-trees north of the
town.&nbsp; Some Jewesses gleaning olives from the ground were frightened
away.&nbsp; Visitors were out at once to welcome us in English, Arabic, and
Judisch, (Jewish-German.)&nbsp; We were surrounded by fair and rosy <!--
page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>complexions of Jews, the effect of the pure bracing air of the
mountain.</p>
<p>My sick people took to their beds, and only after a week&rsquo;s care
(medical such as we could get) were able to continue the journey, one
remaining behind to recover strength.&nbsp; The complaint, however, had not
been cholera, it was rather what is denominated &ldquo;Syrian
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>IX.&nbsp; UPPER GALILEE.&mdash;FOREST SCENERY.</h2>
<p>Tibneen has been already mentioned as one of the two capital villages of
the Bel&acirc;d Besh&acirc;rah, and lying S.E. from Tyre.&nbsp; We have now
before us the Galilean country that lies southwards between that place and
Nazareth.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 1853.&mdash;After honourable entertainment and refreshing
sleep in the Castle of Tibneen, I awoke early to look out on the dark and
broad mass of Mount Hermon by starlight.</p>
<p>Coffee was served, and I was mounted on my &ldquo;gallant gray,&rdquo;
still by twilight, parting with some friends who had been rambling with me
for three weeks over Ph&oelig;nicia and the Lebanon.&nbsp; I set my face in
the direction of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We were guided by the Shaikh of <i>Rumaish</i>, a Christian village that
lay upon the road before us, he being furnished with a written mandate from
Hhamed el Bek, the ruler of Tibneen, to take four men of his place as our
escort through the forest.</p>
<p>In the outskirts of the forest belonging to the <!-- page 265--><a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>castle we found
peasants already proceeding to the threshing-floors; women in lines
marching to the wells with jars cleverly balanced upon their heads; and
camels kneeling on the ground munching their breakfast of cut straw, with
most serious and unchanging expression of countenance, only the large soft
eyes were pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>In half-an-hour we were at <i>Aita</i>.</p>
<p>This country is famous for the quality of its tobacco, a plant that is
most esteemed when grown among the ruined parts of villages, because the
nitre contained in the old cement of houses not only serves to quicken the
vegetation, but imparts to the article that sparkling effect which is
admired when lighted in the pipe.</p>
<p>Vines are also extensively cultivated, and the people take pleasure in
training them aloft upon the high trees, as oak, terebinth, poplar, etc.,
and allowing them to droop down in the graceful festoons of nature, which
also gives an agreeable variety of green colour among the timber trees.</p>
<p>We were entering the gay woodland and reaching the top of a hill, when
the sun rose at our left hand, and the glory of that moment surpassed all
common power of description.&nbsp; Crowds of linnets and finches burst
suddenly into song; the crested larks &ldquo;that tira-lira chant,&rdquo;
<a name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265" class="citation">[265]</a>
rose into the merry blue sky, with <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>the sunlight gleaming
on their plump and speckled breasts; the wood-pigeons, too, were not
silent; but all, in harmonious concert, did their best to praise the
blessed Creator, who delights in the happiness of His creatures.</p>
<p>Forwards we marched with light spirits, through dense woods, varied by
the occasional clearings, which are called &ldquo;the rides&rdquo; in old
English forests, and sometimes we drew near to snug villages, or got
glimpses of such, by the names of <i>Teereh</i>, <i>Hhaneen</i>, and
<i>&rsquo;Ain Nebel</i>; the latter at two hours from Tibneen; the people
there are Christian, and they cultivate silk and tobacco.&nbsp; In some
places we observed ancient sarcophagi, hewn into solid rock without being
entirely detached, they had therefore been left unfinished, though partly
ornamented.</p>
<p>On a ground rising opposite to us I saw the screw of a large press,
standing out of the field; this I was told is used for extracting resin
from the red berries of terebinth trees for domestic lamp-lighting&mdash;a
circumstance which of itself bespeaks the prevalence of woodland round
about, and is a variation from the practice of that unhappy thin population
on the plain of Esdraelon, who are obliged to use castor-oil for the same
purpose, because the <i>palma Christi</i> plants which produce the oil are
of less value to Bedaween marauders than olive-trees would be, and damage
done to <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>them is of less importance than it would be among the latter.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Rumaish</i>, the Shaikh rode up to his village while we
awaited him under the branches of an old oak overshadowing the road.&nbsp;
Rumaish is a neat little place, but, like almost every village throughout
Palestine, oppressed by the heavy debts incurred with the forestallers of
their produce (generally Europeans) in the seaport towns.</p>
<p>Our friend returned with another horseman, and three men on foot, all
armed with guns, as our future way lay through a Druse neighbourhood.</p>
<p>These men for our escort were Maronite Christians, and they showered
upon me abundant salutations, expressing their satisfaction at the
circumstance of a Christian (myself) being treated with such distinguished
consideration in Tibneen Castle, and concluding with the hope that I would
visit them yearly, in order to give countenance to poor, depressed
Christianity.&nbsp; The two priests of the village had desired to come out
and greet me, but their people had persuaded them that the distance was too
great for their walking in the sun&mdash;near mid-day in July.</p>
<p>Resting for a while before resuming the journey, the newcomers sat round
in a circle to smoke their fragrant local tobacco, and find some relief to
the mind in relating tales of suffering under persecution.&nbsp; They said
they had more reason to be satisfied with <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the rule of my host,
Hhamed el Bek, than with that of Tamar Bek at Bint Jebail, which they
described as most cruel and capricious.&nbsp; That I could easily believe
after the incident that came to my knowledge in that vicinity five years
before,&mdash;that of the wanton murder of a poor Christian, at the
lime-kiln works, by a servant of that governor.&nbsp; I have already
mentioned that it was narrated to me by the village priest of &rsquo;Ain
Nebel.&nbsp; An inquiry was instituted into the case by the authorities at
Bayroot; but there must be many such instances occurring that are never
known by those who would or could bring them to light and justice.</p>
<p>At length the signal was given for mounting.&nbsp; The mules were
collected together, after straying about for such pasture as could be got,
their bells gently ringing all the time, and the pipes were stowed away:
those of the muleteers being placed down the backs of their jackets, with
the bowls uppermost, reaching to the men&rsquo;s necks.</p>
<p>We then plunged into the forest of <i>Tarsheehhah</i>, where the Shaikh
of the principal village, that which gives name to the district, is a
fanatic Moslem, who was then preaching religious revivals, and was said to
engraft upon his doctrine the pantheism of the Persian Soofis.&nbsp; This
was not considered improbable, seeing that the Moslems of the Bel&acirc;d
Besh&acirc;rah are all of the Sheah sect, (here called
<i>Met&acirc;wala</i>,) out of which the Soofi heresy is developed.&nbsp;
The new doctrines had spread rapidly <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>in various
directions, and were professed by several of the Effendi class in
Jerusalem&mdash;the old story repeated of Sadducean principles obtaining
among the rich and the luxurious.&nbsp; This Shaikh was described as
excessively intolerant of Christianity, and at that period, viz., the
commencement of the Russian war, was in the habit of travelling about with
a train of disciples, all carrying iron-shod staves in their hands, and
distinguished by having a portion of the muslin of the turban hanging
loosely behind, doing their utmost to excite tumult and hatred of the
Christians by shouting aloud the Mohammedan formula of belief, &ldquo;There
is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the Apostle of God,&rdquo; striking
the ground with their iron-shod staves by way of emphasis.</p>
<p>Among the evergreens, and the gall-oaks, and karoobah-trees, our path
often became very narrow&mdash;sometimes subsiding into sunless hollows,
then mounting afresh into a chequered brilliancy&mdash;but always passing
between woods of dark and glossy foliage.&nbsp; At one place was a pretty
spring of water, where one of the party halted to drink while the rest
proceeded.&nbsp; On finding him fail to come up with us, a horseman and two
footmen were despatched in search.&nbsp; Their shouts gave animation to the
scene, but gradually became fainter as the distance between us
increased.</p>
<p>The whole of the day&rsquo;s journey hitherto was remarkable for absence
of human population.</p>
<p><!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>Came to <i>Herfaish</i>, a Druse village, in the very heart of
the forest, but passed on, still toiling in the hot sunshine.&nbsp;
Occasionally the paths were so rocky that we had to dismount and lead the
horses.</p>
<p>It was evident from the deportment and conversation of our guides, that
whenever Christians (who in that neighbourhood are all Maronites) enter
that division of the forest where the Druses of Herfaish prevail they find
it necessary to travel in companies and armed.&nbsp; Fortunately we
encountered none of the fanatics of Tarsheehhah.&nbsp; The escort told me
that they themselves only became acquainted with these cross roads in the
direction of Nazareth by means of their journeys thither at the
ecclesiastical festivals of Easter, Christmas, etc.</p>
<p>At this hot season there were not many flowers to be noticed, beyond
some varieties of salvia, yellow broom, bright-coloured thistles, the pink
flax, blackberry blossoms, and one kind of heath, together with some plants
unknown to me.</p>
<p>The trees were not of large dimensions, but mostly evergreen and of slow
growth; many were very wide-spreading, and all dense enough to afford good
shelter from either sun or rain.</p>
<p>After six hours and a half of uninterrupted forest we arrived at a small
trickling spring called <i>&rsquo;Ain Noom</i>, when large trees began to
give place to shrubs and underwood, and human inhabitants <!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>again
cheered the sight, they bringing cattle to the water for drinking.</p>
<p>At <i>Bait Jan</i> we were overtaken by the missing member of our
party.&nbsp; At this place there is considerable vine cultivation.&nbsp;
Very soon afterwards we were suddenly upon the brow of a deep
descent&mdash;sheer steep down to the plain of <i>Battoof</i>, and the
prospect from that spot was amazing, not only beyond expectation, for we
had not expected any remarkable scene to come in our way, but beyond all
previous experience.</p>
<p>The whole of Lower Galilee, Samaria, and Gilead, was laid like a map at
our feet; and from so great an elevation the Mediterranean and the Sea of
Galilee were brought close together.&nbsp; Among the most conspicuous
geographical points were Tabor, a very small object beneath; then the line
of Carmel; and Ebal in Samaria; there was Hhatteen, the last battle-field
of the Crusaders; King Baldwin&rsquo;s castle of Cocab; the entrance of the
Jordan into the lake, and both the supposed sites of Capernaum; also Acre
with her blue bay, and a small amount of shipping off Caiffa.&nbsp; Pity
that I had no aneroid barometer for ascertaining the elevation of that
site.</p>
<p>The map-like appearance of the wide panorama suggested to memory the
song of Deborah the prophetess, with her recapitulation of the succours
furnished or omitted by the several tribes of Israel at the battle of the
Kishon and Harosheth of the Gentiles.&nbsp; From such a site she would turn
to the <!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>left hand for expostulation with Reuben, and to the right for
rebuking Dan and Asher upon the sea-coast, after that the Lord had defeated
the national foe without them, and sold Sisera into the hands of a
woman.</p>
<p>Our descent was by a narrow path of zig-zags, veering alternately
towards Acre or Tiberias, although those towns were soon concealed by
intervening hills; the plain below was a large dark patch of olive
plantation.</p>
<p>In an hour and ten minutes of wearisome toil in leading the horses down,
with no possible interval of rest, we came to the village of <i>Rama</i>;
having long before lost sight of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>We took refuge from the sun in the house of a Christian named Ibrahim
Hhanna, and after an hour&rsquo;s sleep rose up to a feast of eggs, olives,
bread, and cream cheese, after sharing in which our guides from Rumaish
took their leave, with kindly wishes on both sides.</p>
<p>Next we hired a guide for our crossing the plain to &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh
el Battoof on the way to Nazareth, and travelled over alternate corn
stubble and balloot underwood.&nbsp; In one short valley that we crossed
there were six <i>jeldeh</i> or short aqueducts to water-mills.</p>
<p>The weather was still extremely hot.</p>
<p>Passed near <i>Dair Hhanna</i>, a large ruin of a fortification upon a
hill rising out of the plain; probably, as the name would seem to intimate,
an old <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>castle of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem.&nbsp; A few poor
people here have built huts for themselves within the great walls, in the
manner of the Italian peasants in Goldsmith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo; who do the same within the confines of a
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s palace&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And wondering man can want the larger pile,<br />
Exult and own their cottage with a smile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two small towers, now also in ruin, flank the castle at short
distances.&nbsp; These were erected by Shaikh Daher about eighty years
since, who employed the whole for military defence in his revolt against
the Turks.</p>
<p>Near this &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh lie some time-eaten fragments of large old
columns.&nbsp; There we dismissed the guide, as he wished to be at home
again before dark, and we traversed the plain of <i>Sefur&icirc;yeh</i>,
the celebrated Sepphoris of Josephus&rsquo; wars.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that in that afternoon we had crossed three narrow
but long parallel plains, all running east and west, and divided from each
other by lines of rocky hills.&nbsp; The northern one contains <i>Rama</i>
and <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh</i>; the middle one has <i>Sefur&icirc;yeh</i>;
and the southern one has <i>Tura&rsquo;&acirc;n</i> and <i>Cuf&rsquo;r
Cana</i>, the place of the miracle at the marriage in St John&rsquo;s
Gospel.</p>
<p>Hoping to reach our destination by a shorter track, after passing
<i>Rum&acirc;neh</i> and Jerjer we mounted a hill to <i>Mesh-had</i>, that
was in sight, but as darkness came on, lost our way for a considerable
time; <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>rain threatened and fell a short time.&nbsp; Once we came near a
large cattle-fold, which we afterwards learned belonged to the Latin
Convent of Nazareth, but no people appeared to answer us; then we got a
gloomy view of Mount Tabor; at length, however, we were cheered with
discovering the window lights of Nazareth, after being fourteen hours in
the saddle, omitting the two hours&rsquo; rest at Rama, and the half-hour
at Rumaish.</p>
<p>The whole country we had traversed is particularly interesting; but at
the close of the day the company were all too tired to sing aloud, as might
have been performed under other circumstances, that Arab song well known
over the country, with its wild high note (not cadence) at the end of each
line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;If thy horse be indeed<br />
&nbsp;  A creature of speed<br />
Thou wilt lodge for the night in Nazareth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In December of the next year (1854) I traversed the Rama plain
lengthwise, that is to say, from Tiberias to the plain of Acre.</p>
<p>After <i>Mejdal</i> and the <i>Wadi el Ham&acirc;m</i>, or &ldquo;Valley
of the Doves,&rdquo; we soon struck out due westwards, and passed under a
hill with ruins on its top called <i>Sab&acirc;neh</i>; then some more
considerable ruins in a similar position called <i>Memileh</i>.&nbsp; At a
good way to our left a small village was pointed out called
<i>&rsquo;Ailabool</i>, containing, among other inhabitants, a few
Christians, who have their chapel and a priest.</p>
<p><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>The whole road was extremely picturesque&mdash;the scenery
consisting of broken rocks of ochreous tinge and shoots of balloot oak; and
for a long distance at every turn, in looking backwards, there showed
itself the still lovely lake of the Gospel narratives&mdash;that object
which no one can ever forget who has had once the privilege to be near
it.</p>
<p>We kept <i>Mansoorah</i> steadily before the eye, but on arriving at the
hill upon which this stands, the road deviated a little, and rose over an
eminence side by side with the village.&nbsp; Here we got a view of those
several separated objects&mdash;Tabor; the Sea of Galilee; and Dair
Hhanna.</p>
<p>We were accosted by some Druse peasantry when the village of
<i>Mogh&acirc;r</i> was somewhat on our left.</p>
<p>While passing the large olive plantations of <i>Rama</i>, we gazed up at
the long and steep ladder of the precipice by which we had descended last
year.</p>
<p>Rama is at some height above the level of the plain, although low in
proportion to the mountain at its back.</p>
<p>Just before sunset we halted under the trees for refreshment about a
quarter of an hour, then engaged a guide to conduct us to <i>Yerka</i>, on
the plain of Acre.</p>
<p>The man purposely led us up to the village of Rama, over a very stony
road, hoping to induce us to stay there for the night on the way to
Yerka.&nbsp; <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>When I refused to remain, and insisted on going forwards, he took
us into places even worse for travelling, to the peril of limbs to
ourselves and the horses and mules: and great was our just wrath on finding
ourselves every few minutes in augmented trouble in utter darkness; for
there was no moon, and the stars were hid by clouds.&nbsp; The
horses&rsquo; feet were sometimes caught between close-wedged rocks, so
that we had to lift them out with our hands, and our boots were with
difficulty extricated from the same catch-traps; nevertheless the traitor
trudged on nimbly a-head of us, heedless of our embarrassments.&nbsp; Had
he not led us up to Rama at the beginning we should have kept upon a
pleasant, well-beaten road on the level of the general plain.</p>
<p>At length by our own efforts we got down to this highway, and trudged on
at a good pace, the guide still trotting on in advance, out of reach of our
hands, fearful of consequences, until we reached <i>Mejdal Croom</i>, (or
<i>Migdol</i>, or Tower of the Vineyards in Hebrew,) where he swore that
Yerka was still three hours before us, and that he was exhausted with
fatigue.&nbsp; As we were so in reality, we halted, and with great trouble
obtained a room in the village for the night.</p>
<p>In the morning it was discovered that Yerka was only half-an-hour in
advance, but the mischievous fellow was already gone back to where we had
unfortunately picked him up.</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>In the house of our lodging I was amused by seeing rude paintings
upon the white-washed walls, rather good for native Palestine artists of
the nineteenth century.&nbsp; The principal object was a three-masted ship,
actually containing what were intended for human figures; (perhaps it was a
Christian, not a Mohammedan house.)&nbsp; On the masts were very large
flags of no special nationality, but one of them in exactly the opposite
direction from the others.&nbsp; The three men, (constructed of lines for
limbs and a dot for the head,) looking through telescopes, were taking
observations in different quarters; but perhaps this may be
allowed&mdash;two men formed the crew.&nbsp; There were no sails, and the
mainmast had one yard-arm, the rest had none.&nbsp; Up in the air, near the
ship&rsquo;s masts, were two Arabs on horseback carrying spears; the whole
tableau was coloured, as such works in the East always are, of a uniform
dull red.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;We were within sight of the sea and the fortress of
Acre.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The three previous chapters, and this one at its commencement, relate in
no inconsiderable proportion to woods, glens, and glades included in proper
forest scenery; but inasmuch as travellers in Palestine, describing only
what they have themselves seen along high-roads from town to town, under
the guidance of professional dragomans and muleteers, generally deny the
existence of forest <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>scenery in Palestine, I may subjoin some
remarks on this particular subject.</p>
<p>Passing over the extensive olive plantations of Gaza, and the Sahara of
twenty square miles between Bayroot and Saida, as not exactly belonging to
the class of timber trees; and the &ldquo;pine forest&rdquo; near Bayroot,
which is of artificial formation for accomplishing a preconceived design;
also the neb&rsquo;k and other thorny trees unfit for mechanical purposes,
extending for miles in wild profusion beyond Jericho, and adding beauty to
the scenery; there remain the veritable forests of Gilead and Bashan beyond
Jordan, seldom visited by European travellers, and the two large forests in
Western Palestine, accessible to the tourists who have leisure and will for
knowing the country.</p>
<p>First, the Bel&acirc;d Besh&acirc;rah to the north, north-east, and east
of Tibneen, and also west and south-west of Safed, through all of which I
have travelled with unceasing admiration and indulgence of the early taste
implanted in childhood among old forests of England.&nbsp; The verdure and
the shade from the Syrian sun were delightful, with the glades and vistas,
as well as the amusing alternations often occurring of stooping to the
horse&rsquo;s neck in passing below the venerable branches that stretched
across the roadway.&nbsp; Those sylvan scenes abound in game, and are known
to contain formidable wild animals.</p>
<p>Secondly, the forest extending in length at least <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>thirty miles from
below C&aelig;sarea, northwards to the plain of Battoof beyond
Sepphoris.&nbsp; This was designated the &ldquo;ingens sylva&rdquo; by the
ancient Romans.&nbsp; I have crossed this in several lines between Nazareth
and Acre or Caiffa; and twice from the Plain of Sharon to Carmel through
the <i>Wadi &rsquo;Arah</i> by <i>Umm el Fahh&rsquo;m</i>, a village, the
very name of which (&ldquo;mother of charcoal&rdquo;) belongs to a woodland
region; besides the line from Carmel to <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh</i>.</p>
<p>The portion of this forest immediately contiguous inland from Carmel is
named &ldquo;the R&ocirc;hha,&rdquo; clearly from the fragrance exhaled by
the pine and terebinth trees, with the wild herbs upon the hills; this,
together with the dark wooded sides of the long mountain, constitutes
&ldquo;the forest of his Carmel&rdquo; mentioned in the boasting of the
King of Assyria, (Isa. xxxvii. 24; also x. 18, in Hebrew,) and it is the
<i>Drymos</i> of the Septuagint and of Josephus, (Wars, i. 13, 2,) in the
which a battle was fought by those Jews who were aiding the Parthians on
behalf of Antigonus.&nbsp; No wonder that the loss of men was considerable
among the woods and thickets there.&nbsp; I note the accuracy of assigning
the name <i>&Delta;&rho;&nu;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i> to this region,
consisting as it does almost exclusively of oak.</p>
<p>Besides these wide tracts of woodland, there are also the summit and
sides of Tabor, with woods along its north-eastern base.</p>
<p>And the district south and south-west of Hebron, in which, besides oak,
etc., pine timber is frequent,<!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>&mdash;I should rather say was, for of late
years it has been much devastated, and that too in an unmethodical manner,
to meet the increased requirements of Jerusalem, Bethlehem, etc., for fuel;
nay, as I have been told, shiploads of it are constantly conveyed away to
Egypt, especially for works on the Suez Canal.&nbsp; In like manner, in
creeks of the sea between Acre and Bayroot, may frequently be seen small
vessels loading with wood for Egypt.</p>
<p>Throughout all the period of my experience in Palestine, I have had
reason to deplore destruction of the growing timber by charcoal-burners in
various provinces.&nbsp; I have seen the sides of whole hills in a blaze,
purposely kindled and then left by these men to perform the work with least
trouble to themselves: the Government takes no heed in the matter, and no
care is employed for propagation of new trees to succeed the blackened ruin
thus produced.</p>
<p>So it would appear that in ancient periods, when the land was well
peopled, the very wants of that population would, as in every other
country, keep down the growth of forests.&nbsp; In the military periods of
Roman and other invasions, large timber was required for offensive and
defensive operations; and in our generation, when the population there is
exceedingly diminished, the ignorance, the bad government, and the
wastefulness of uncivilisation, produce the same result of destroying or
hindering the increase of timber growth.</p>
<p><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>There are not many parts of Palestine more bare of timber trees
than the interval between Jerusalem and Bethlehem; yet there are old houses
in the latter town whose owners pride themselves on the strong, stout
rafters and planks they contain, of a quality known far around by the name
of Bethlehem oak, and there are persons still living who can remember
oak-trees near Solomon&rsquo;s pools.</p>
<p>That this neighbourhood was formerly well wooded is still proved by the
tufts of evergreen oak which spring up everywhere over the hills.&nbsp;
These tufts of brushwood are found to come from immense roots, each one
enough for several camel-loads of fire-wood.&nbsp; They are dug up by the
peasantry, and sold in Jerusalem for fuel, under the name of
Car&acirc;meh.</p>
<p>It is popularly said that &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; a man of
Jerusalem went to reside at Hebron, and the usual chequered events of life
occurred, ending in the calamity of losing his eyesight.&nbsp; In extreme
old age he resolved upon returning to his native city, and when he reached
the Convent of Mar Elias, half-way between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, the
weather being hot, he took off his turban to rest it on the saddle before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, our father,&rdquo; said his sons, who were walking by
his side, &ldquo;why art thou uncovering the bareness of thy
head?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I may enjoy
the coolness that is to be enjoyed beneath the trees that I remember to
have been by the roadside all the way <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>hence to
Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; They assured him that not only did no such avenue
exist, but that not a tree was to be seen in any direction, right or left,
and that much of the change was owing to the hostilities that had been
carried on among the villages under the laxity of the Turkish
government.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;then turn back,
my sons, and let me die where I have lived so long; Jerusalem is no longer
what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This anecdote, current among the peasantry, describes strongly, by its
very simplicity, the process that for centuries has been in operation to
reduce that country to the condition in which we now find it.</p>
<p>I ought not to leave the subject of forest scenery in Palestine without
inviting attention to the eloquent passages in Dr Thomson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Land and the Book&rdquo; upon that subject.&nbsp; This veteran
missionary of the Lebanon knows the whole country well, and being an
American of the Far West, has been accustomed to large forests, huge trees,
and charms of woodland scenery; yet he speaks with rapture of the groves
about Banias&mdash;the solemn glens and verdure of the Bel&acirc;d
Besh&acirc;rah, and the magnificence of the Sindi&acirc;neh.&nbsp; This
author has a keen relish for all the varied beauties of nature, and
possesses the faculty of describing them so as to enable us to share in its
healthful gratifications.</p>

283</span>X.&nbsp; A TEMPLE OF BAAL AND SEPULCHRE OF PH&OElig;NICIA.</h2>
<p>About midway between Tyre and Sidon lies what has been called by Porter
and Tristram a kind of Syrian Stonehenge; but neither they nor Vandevelde,
who likewise mentions it, really visited the spot.</p>
<p>The remains are not even mentioned in Carl Ritter&rsquo;s elaborate
compilation, the &ldquo;Erd-Kunde,&rdquo; nor in Robinson or Thompson; but
as I have visited them five times, namely in October 1848, October 1849,
September 1855, October 1857, and September 1859, I may as well tell what I
know of these monuments, which I believe to be of some importance.</p>
<p>The site on which they stand is a large open cultivated ground, nearly
opposite <i>Sarafend</i>, (Sarepta,) between the high-road and the sea, a
quarter of an hour south of the vestiges of <i>Adloon</i>, whose broken
columns and large pieces of tesselated pavement lie actually upon the
highway, so that our horses and mules walk over the household pavements, or
the road pavement of hexagonal slabs.&nbsp; <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Adloon may be at half
distance between Soor and Saida.&nbsp; It has been conjectured that the
name is an Arabic modification of <i>Adnoun</i>, and that again derived
from <i>Ad nonum</i>, meaning the ninth Roman mile from Tyre; but as far as
my memory serves me, that does not correspond with the real distance.</p>
<p>There are upright stones standing from four to six feet each above the
present level of the ground, but which may not be the original level.&nbsp;
There may have been a considerable rise accumulated in process of
time.&nbsp; The largest stone still shows six feet by a breadth of
two.&nbsp; They anciently formed a parallelogram, (not a circle, which is
commonly believed to be an emblem belonging to Baal-worship,) as may be
seen in the following plan, which represents their present
appearance:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p284.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient construction at Adloon" src="images/p284.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The twelve stones marked <i>0</i> are still erect; the rest, whose
places are marked by dots, are either <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>prostrate on the
ground, or have entirely disappeared.&nbsp; Between them all are spaces of
two or three yards each.&nbsp; The stones appear to have been carefully
hewn originally, though now the edges are worn off, or pieces have fallen
away from the substances of most of them.&nbsp; They bear, however, no
chisel-indications of having been connected by lintels across the tops:
they have not been placed as trilithons.</p>
<p>Outside the parallelogram, at the distance of six yards, stand two other
stones of the same description, which probably served as a portal of
approach.</p>
<p>Within the enclosure is a depression of ground, in an oval shape, almost
filled up with weeds, which demands but little effort of imagination to
suggest the position of an altar now removed, leaving only the hollow
orifice of a channel for carrying away blood or ashes.&nbsp; This may be
worth an examination hereafter.</p>
<p>There are tokens of buildings having stood near, but these may have been
of later date.&nbsp; I picked up a fragment of tesselated pavement there,
but that may have come there by means of any conceivable accident from
Adloon.</p>
<p>Such is my simple account of what I cannot but believe to have been a
temple of Baal-worship for the old Ph&oelig;nicians, certainly of earlier
period than any Greek or Roman architecture in the country; and vestiges
such as these, of antique Syrian monuments, may, on careful examination,
furnish <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>us with data, useful in enabling us to understand the Celtic
remains still found in Europe.</p>
<p>The nearest village to these remains, though at some distance upon the
hills, is <i>Sairi</i>, hence the place is named <i>Sook Sairi</i>, from
the circumstance of a &ldquo;market&rdquo; of cattle and general goods
being held there periodically for the district around.&nbsp; But why should
this spot above all others in the long-deserted plain be used for such a
market?&nbsp; Is it not a traditional continuance of some remote custom in
connexion with the importance conferred by the ancient temple and its
now-forgotten worship?&nbsp; Who can tell us through how many ages this
rural fair has been held at Sairi or Adloon?</p>
<p>The peasant account of the stones is that they were formerly men, whom
God, or a prophet in His name, turned into stones for their wickedness,
while they were employed in reaping a harvest; further my informant could
not tell.&nbsp; The narrative closely resembled the explanation given me by
country people in England respecting some almost similar stones at
Long-Compton, on the border between Oxfordshire and Warwickshire; and I
think I remember to have read of similar instances in other parts of
England.</p>
<p>Vandevelde was told that this miracle was wrought by Nebi Zer, (whose
weli is in the neighbourhood,) and that this prophet Zer was nephew to
Joshua, the son of Nun,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if he understood his interpreter
aright.</p>
<p><!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>I cannot well leave that vicinity without mentioning the long
lines of sepulchres excavated in the cliff-line which runs parallel to the
sea, eastwards of the highway, and upon the crest of which line Sarafend
and other villages are posted.&nbsp; These sepulchres have been noticed by
travellers generally, even while merely passing along without leaving the
beaten track, others have taken the trouble to visit them, but without
finding any inscriptions.&nbsp; I have seen one inscription, the following
in Greek, and apparently unfinished:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&Pi;&Alpha;&Tau;&Epsilon;&Rho;<br />
&Alpha;&Rho;&Iota;&Sigma;&Tau;&Omicron;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although in some respects these resemble the sepulchres near Jerusalem,
they are not so elaborately formed into passages and inner chambers as the
latter.&nbsp; Many of the excavations high above the ground have been at
some era adapted to residences for hermits.</p>
<p>Near Saida I have been shown sepulchres that were entered by steps and
passages, and coated with very hard stucco, on which were pictures in
fresco of festoons of olive and vine leaves alternated, these leaves being
diversified sometimes with tints of autumnal brown, also trees of palm or
olive, with birds upon their branches; the birds being all of one kind,
with long tails, and coloured bright yellow and red, with brown
backs.&nbsp; Inasmuch as these portray living creatures they must be <!--
page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>ascribed to some classical, <i>i.e.</i>, ante-Islamitic
epoch.&nbsp; The designing and colouring of them are excellent, and the
work remains in good preservation; they are most likely of Roman art, for
their style much resembles the wall pictures of Pompeii.</p>
<p>I have met with no mention of these decorated sepulchres, but in
Ritter&rsquo;s quotation from Mariti, (Saida&rsquo;s Umgebungen in vol. iv.
I, page 410,) and that only lately.</p>
<p>The sepulchre which I entered consisted of one principal chamber, at
each side of which were three smaller recesses, besides two such opposite
the entrance.&nbsp; These latter have others proceeding further within
them.&nbsp; There are no low shelves as in the Jud&aelig;an sepulchres, but
the dead were laid in shallow trenches sunk in the rocky floor.&nbsp; The
stucco has only been employed to the right and left of the principal
chamber.</p>
<p>I pass over, as not belonging to this subject, the more recent discovery
by others near the town in 1855 of the two sarcophagi, one of them bearing
a Ph&oelig;nician inscription.</p>

289</span>XI.&nbsp; JERUSALEM TO PETRA, AND RETURN BY THE DEAD SEA.</h2>
<p>During the last twenty years there have been many English and other
visitors to Petra; but they have usually taken it in the way from Egypt
towards Jerusalem, which is probably convenient with respect to the season
of the year, inasmuch as they thereby get a warm winter before the
&ldquo;sights&rdquo; of Jerusalem (as some irreverently speak) begin.&nbsp;
It would not be so well to take Egypt after Easter.</p>
<p>But, on hearing that several travellers had been unable to reach Petra
even after &rsquo;Akabah, on account of hostilities arising between the
Alaween and the Tiy&acirc;hah Arabs, or on account of the exorbitant
demands of money made by the former of these, I thought the time had
arrived for me to show the practicability of getting at the wonders of
Petra from Jerusalem, under escort of the Jeh&acirc;leen Arabs near
Hebron.</p>
<p>I went accordingly, and treated with the Fellahheen of Wadi Moosa in the
place itself; and numerous travellers have since availed themselves of this
<!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>advantage, though none have published an account of their
expedition.</p>
<p>On looking back at my notes of the journey, I am astonished at the rapid
flight of time; for although my recollection is on the whole very vivid,
these notes are dated in April 1851.&nbsp; Full occupation during the
intervening period has seemed to shorten the interval.&nbsp; The scene,
too, is now changed; for instead of the arid desert and the blasted
porphyry cliffs of Edom, then before my eyes, these lines are penned among
the bright green meadows of England, with the broad Thames in view, bearing
large three-masted ships on its tide, freighted with imports from the most
distant parts of the world.</p>
<p>With an officer of dragoons, being a traveller in Jerusalem, and under
escort of Hamzeh, the Hebron agent for the Jeh&acirc;leen, we proceeded
across country to meet the Arabs in their wilderness.</p>
<p>Leaving the Hebron road at <i>&rsquo;Ain Dirweh</i>, we ascended the
lofty hill to the little village and weli of <i>Nebi Yunas</i>, (Prophet
Jonah,) which is so conspicuous an object far away in every
direction,&mdash;the minaret which rises from the building giving it very
much the appearance of a rural church in Europe.&nbsp; Thence through
well-cultivated fields of wheat and barley,&mdash;green at that
season,&mdash;towards the village of <i>Beni Naim</i>; but at quarter of
the intermediate distance, passed considerable remains of good masonry,
named Khirbet <i>Bait Ainoon</i>, <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>(ruins of Beth
Enon.)&nbsp; At <i>Beni Naim</i> is the reputed sepulchre of the Prophet
Lot, according to the Moslems; that of his daughters being on an opposite
hill at no great distance.&nbsp; This village commands a grand prospect of
the Dead Sea, although there is no view of the kind from all the country
around.&nbsp; Is not this the place whence Abraham, after the departure of
the angels, saw the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah rising as the smoke of a
furnace?&nbsp; (Gen. xix. 27, 28.)</p>
<p>Here was a travelling durweesh, fantastically dressed, amusing the
peasants by dancing and cracking a long whip; while a lad accompanying him
thumped a large drum,&mdash;both the thonged whip and the large drum being
rare objects in that country.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour we terminated our short day&rsquo;s journey
(about six hours and a half) in a meadow of long green grass.&nbsp; The
site is called <i>Beerain</i>, from the two wells there.&nbsp;
Sel&acirc;meh, the brother of the Arab chief, with several of his people,
were awaiting our arrival; and they were to lead us forward in the
morning.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 2.&mdash;My right knee was much swollen from the strain of
a sinew, caused by an unexpected step down a bank taken by my horse when
near <i>Hhalhhool</i>, on the road from Jerusalem; consequently, feeling
feverish, and with a headache all night, I was not soothed by the camels
groaning, quarrelling, or champing their food close to my tent.</p>
<p><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>In the morning we made our bargain with Sel&acirc;meh, for the
hire of camels, the escort, etc.&nbsp; The captain and I, with my
attendants, were to ride our horses in the desert,&mdash;taking camels to
carry an extra supply of water for them.</p>
<p>We started, but in a very short time became disgusted at the slow
travelling of our caravan, as we were compelled to moderate the pace of our
riding to suit the leisurely tread of the camels.&nbsp; Sel&acirc;meh
bestrode a very young colt of the K&rsquo;baishi race; but I rated my pony,
of the Jilfi stock, still higher than his.</p>
<p>The wide expanse before us was sprinkled with wild flowers, including
the yellow furze, (I have beside me, while writing this, a bunch of the
same, of English growth;) and the ret&rsquo;m, or juniper, seven or eight
feet in height, covered with white blossom, the fragrance of which
resembled, or, if possible, was an improvement upon, the smell of a
bean-field in flower.</p>
<p>Near <i>Ziph</i>, the rocks have many ancient wells cut into their solid
substance.&nbsp; About noon we halted at a rough natural cistern, for the
purpose of filling our barrels and kirbehs (goat and camel skins) with
water.&nbsp; This task occupied an hour, during which I contrived to find
just enough shade for my head under a big stone, but took refuge in the
cistern itself while the camels were being reloaded.</p>
<p>Leaving this, we found the waste plains abounding in locusts
innumerable, and not full grown.&nbsp; As <!-- page 293--><a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>a natural
consequence, there were storks hovering about and feasting upon them.&nbsp;
On account of the benefit thus conferred on mankind by these birds, the
Arabs call them <i>Abu Sa&rsquo;ad</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Father of good
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon we arrived at the encampment of the
Jeh&acirc;leen, under the north-east side of Tell <i>&rsquo;Ar&acirc;d</i>,
the site of the Canaanitish city in Num. xxi. I, xxxiii. 40; Judges i.
16.&nbsp; It was a cheerful green site, though the verdure consisted merely
of a thin and poor grass.</p>
<p>We had to be introduced to the real shaikh on his own territorial
domain, namely, Hadji Daif Allah abu Dahook,&mdash;a sharp fellow in
driving a bargain,&mdash;a taller and stouter man than any of his people,
who were all extremely dirty in person and dress, and several of them but
small, withered-looking old men.&nbsp; One of the women, however, was tall,
and walked with exceeding dignity of manner.</p>
<p>Our European tents were pitched at some distance from the black hair
tents of the Arabs and we observed, soon after our arrival, that three
strangers came up on horseback, carrying spears tufted with black ostrich
feathers, on a visit to our shaikh.&nbsp; They were well received; and
songs, with clapping of hands, continued during a great part of the night,
with a monotonous accompaniment of the women grinding corn in their
hand-mills!</p>
<p><!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span><i>April</i> 3.&mdash;We rose early, enjoying the indescribable
beauty and purity of starlight in an oriental desert, thermometer,
Fahrenheit, 53&frac14;&deg;, at sunrise; but before sunrise I mounted to
the summit of the hill, where I found no vestiges of a city, only the
foundation of a castle, or some such edifice, of about a hundred feet by
sixty.&nbsp; In fact, this covered nearly the whole surface of the
summit.&nbsp; The city must, therefore, have been situated on the plain,
the metropolis of a petty Canaanitish king; but every trace of it is
gone.</p>
<p>Low hills bounded the view on every side, over which some peaks of the
Moab mountains showed themselves in the east.</p>
<p>When fairly started on the march at 10 past 6 <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we went along very cheerily, accompanied by
Hadji Daif Allah and the three strangers, till, on a sudden, the latter
wheeled about, and required from us the ghuf&rsquo;r, or toll, for our
future passage through their country.&nbsp; The shaikh recommended us to
make them a present of a couple of dollars, as they were neighbours of
Petra, and without their good-will we should not be able to succeed in the
expedition.</p>
<p>We complied, and they rode off southwards, Abu Dahook returning to his
camp.</p>
<p>Wearisome indeed is travelling with camels; but what would it have been
had we been mounted upon them, as is generally the case with travellers
from Sinai and &rsquo;Akabah!&nbsp; We horsemen frequently <!-- page
295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>imitated the
practice of old Fadladeen in <i>Lalla Rookh</i>, when he rode ahead of his
caravan, and alighted now and then to enjoy the spectacle of the procession
coming up and passing, then mounted again to repeat the pleasure.</p>
<p>The strongest and worst tempered one of our camels having the barrels of
water to carry, suddenly lay down and rolled them from him.&nbsp; Had his
burden been the skins of water instead, they would have burst, and we
should have lost their precious contents.&nbsp; Our Arabs not being
accustomed to the convoy of travellers, were as yet unskilful in loading
the camels, or in poising the burdens in equal divisions; and most
extraordinary noises did they make in urging the beasts
forward,&mdash;sounds utterly indescribable in European writing, or even by
any combinations of the Arabic alphabet!</p>
<p>We had about half a dozen men, mostly trudging on foot, and but slightly
armed, commanded by Sel&acirc;meh; and one of them, named Salem, was the
merry-andrew of the party, full of verbal and practical jokes.&nbsp; The
ride was exhilarating,&mdash;over a level plain, green with thin grass or
weeds, and low shrubs, whose roots extended to surprising distances, mostly
above the surface of the ground; the morning breeze delicious, with larks
trilling high above us in the sky, and smaller birds that sang among the
bushes.</p>
<p>Sometimes we caught distant views of <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>innumerable storks
devouring the infant locusts upon the hill-sides.</p>
<p>Passed <i>&rsquo;Ain Mel&rsquo;hh</i>, (Salt-fountain,) which Robinson
identifies with the Moladah of Joshua xix. 2, by means of the transition
name of Malatha in Greek.&nbsp; The only building now remaining is a square
weli, surmounted by a dome.&nbsp; Here we were not far from Beersheba, upon
our right, and fell in with the common route from Gaza and Hebron to
Ma&rsquo;&acirc;n.&nbsp; Finding a flock of goats, we got new milk from the
shepherd; when diluted with water, this is a refreshing beverage.</p>
<p>On coming up to a camp of Saadeen Arabs, our cook, a vain-glorious
Maronite from the Lebanon, and ignorant of Arab customs, attempted to fire
upon a watch-dog at the tents for barking at him; and it was judged
necessary to deprive him of his pistols for the rest of the journey.&nbsp;
Had he succeeded in his folly, we should have got into considerable
trouble; for an Arab watch-dog is accounted so valuable, that to kill one
of them might have entailed upon us a long delay, and a formal trial in a
council of elders of different tribes, collected for the purpose; followed
by the penalty awarded by the unwritten laws which obtain in the desert,
namely, a payment of as much fine wheat as would entirely cover the dog
when held up by his tail, and the nose touching the ground, and this is no
small quantity; such <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>delay would have probably thwarted our whole
journey.</p>
<p>At a narrow pass, called <i>Daiket &rsquo;Ar&acirc;r</i>, was the shell
of an old building, now roofless.&nbsp; Near this, and by the wayside, as
we advanced, were considerable remains of foundations of houses.&nbsp;
There must have been a town of note at that place, it is the &rsquo;Aroer
of 1 Sam. xxx. 28.&nbsp; Our course now suddenly trended towards the east,
instead of southwards.</p>
<p>In less than another hour we came to <i>Kubbet el Baul</i>, merely the
foundation of a small weli.&nbsp; Sel&acirc;meh told us that this had
belonged to a tribe called Bali, (or Baul in the plural.)&nbsp; I have no
doubt that this is the site of <i>Balah</i> of Joshua xix. 3; and that from
it the Arabs, settling near it afterwards, derived their appellation.</p>
<p>We soon afterwards, 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, passed
<i>Curnub</i>, a ruined place on the right, and descended the slope of
<i>Muzaikah</i>.</p>
<p>In another hour and a half, namely, at half-past four, we halted for the
night, after a journey of ten hours.&nbsp; It was on a smooth, pebbly
plain, dotted with shrubs, having lines of chalky hills to the south-west,
for which our people had no other name than <i>Jebel el Ghurb</i>, or the
&ldquo;western mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole scene was that of a mere
desert; no creatures were to be seen or heard but ourselves.&nbsp; No
Turkish authorities ever intrude into <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>this purely Arab
wilderness; still less was the landscape spoiled by the smoke of European
factories.&nbsp; No speck of cloud had we seen the whole day through.</p>
<p>Not far from this must have transpired the incidents recorded of Hagar
and Ishmael,&mdash;incidents that might have occurred yesterday, or last
week; for a few thousand years count but little in so primitive a
region.</p>
<p>Our ragged fellows ran about singing, in search of thorns or long roots,
or even the straggling plants of bitter colocynth, as fuel for our
cooking-fire.</p>
<p>Stars arose, but such stars! not like the spangles of the English
poet&rsquo;s conception, those &ldquo;patines of bright gold,&rdquo; though
that idea is beautiful; but one could see that they were round orbs that
flashed streams of diamond light from out their bigness.</p>
<p>So luxurious a bed as that spread upon the desert sand, amid such pure
air for breathing, is scarcely to be obtained but in exactly similar
circumstances; and we were undisturbed by cries of any wild beasts,
although jackals and hyenas are common at night in the more cultivated
parts of Palestine.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 4.&mdash;Thermometer, Fahrenheit, 53&frac34;&deg; at
sunrise.&nbsp; We had our breakfast, and were off again by sunrise.&nbsp;
It is said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Early to bed, and early to rise,<br />
Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>It remained to be seen what the effect would be upon us.</p>
<p>The groom being left behind a short time for packing up the kitchen
utensils, allowed us to get out of sight without his observing the
direction we had taken; and, when mounted, he took a wrong course.&nbsp; It
was therefore necessary to give chase towards the hills to recover him.</p>
<p>In an hour we reached two tul&rsquo;hh (acacia or mimosa) trees, from
which, I believe, the gum-arabic is obtained, and the stump of a
third.&nbsp; These were the first that we had seen.&nbsp; Then descended,
during about half an hour, to the broken walls of a town called
<i>Suf&acirc;h</i>, below which commenced the very remarkable
nuk&rsquo;beh, or precipitous slope into the great Wadi
&rsquo;Arabah.&nbsp; Before commencing this, however, we paused to survey
the savage scenery around us, and the glorious expanse of the plain, which
extends from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea, and is bounded on one side by the
hills of Jud&aelig;a, and on the other by the mountains of Edom,&mdash;on
an average of 3500 feet above the level,&mdash;including Mount Hor, the
most conspicuous peak among them.&nbsp; At that time, however, the range
was capped with rolling mists of the morning.</p>
<p>This <i>Suf&acirc;h</i> is most likely the <i>Zephath</i> of Judges i.
17,&mdash;the frontier town of King Arad the Canaanite, which the tribes of
Judah and Simeon destroyed, and called the site Hormah, (<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;devoted to destruction.&rdquo;)&nbsp; If so, it is strange that the
<!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>Canaanitish name should outlive the one intentionally given by
the early Israelites.&nbsp; Probably, the surrounding tribes never adopted
the Hebrew name, and preserved the original one.</p>
<p>We were standing among crevasses of shivered mountains, whose strata are
tossed about in fantastic contortions; and what we had yet to traverse
below this, was something like a thousand feet of very slippery rock, lying
in flakes, and sloping two ways at once.&nbsp; The greater length forms a
rough line, at an angle of what seemed to the eye to be one of forty-five
degrees,&mdash;not so steep as the Ter&acirc;beh that we came to
afterwards, but longer and more perilous.&nbsp; Yet this is the only
approach to Jud<i>&aelig;</i>a from the desert for many leagues
around.&nbsp; Was it here that King Amaziah destroyed his Edomite prisoners
after his victory in the &ldquo;valley of salt?&rdquo;&nbsp; (2 Chron. xxv.
12.)</p>
<p>Half way down, one of our barrels of water slipped off a camel, and
rolled into a chasm with noise and echoes like thunder.&nbsp; Wonderful to
relate, it was not broken, and we were thankful for its preservation.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the precipice, just beyond the shingle or debris of the
mountain, the captain and I rested, and drank some camels&rsquo;
milk.&nbsp; This the Bedaween consider very strengthening.&nbsp; There were
several tul&rsquo;hh-trees in a torrent-bed beside us, and some
neb&rsquo;k.&nbsp; With some twine that we <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>gave him, and a stout
thorn of tul&rsquo;hh, one of our Arabs mended his sandal, which was in
need of repair.&nbsp; We, having preceded the beasts of burthen over the
slippery rock, sat watching them and the men creeping slowly down, in
curved lines, like moving dots, towards us.</p>
<p>Upon the ground we found some dried palm-branches and slips of vine,
which must have belonged to some former travellers, passing from the
western towns to Ma&rsquo;&acirc;n, for neither palm nor vine grows in this
wilderness, of which it may be truly said, &ldquo;It is no place of seed,
or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates,&rdquo; (Num. xx. 5;) and it is
now become like a past dream, that Virgil and Lucan mentioned the
palm-trees of Idum&aelig;a. <a name="citation301"></a><a
href="#footnote301" class="citation">[301]</a></p>
<p>So at length we were upon the great &rsquo;Arabah, or &ldquo;wilderness
of Zin,&rdquo; of the Israelitish wanderings; and our path was to be
diagonally across this, pointed direct at Mount Hor in the south-east.</p>
<p>On crossing a shallow wadi named <i>Fik&rsquo;r</i>, they told us of a
spring of water to be found in it, at a good distance to the
north-east.</p>
<p>After some hours, we came to <i>Wadi Jaib</i>, sometimes styled the
Jeshimon, as well as its corresponding plain on the north of the Dead Sea,
and in Arabic both are called &ldquo;the Gh&ocirc;r,&rdquo; in the shallow
<!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>bed of which were receptacles for water, concealed by canes and
brushwood laid in the utmost disorder, so as to produce the appearance of
mere random drift of winter storms.&nbsp; Without the Arabs, of course, we
should never have suspected the existence of such valuable stores.&nbsp;
Probably also the Bedaween from a distance would not be aware of such
resources there.&nbsp; The covering would, besides, serve to prevent a
speedy evaporation of the water by the sun&rsquo;s heat.&nbsp; These spots
were shaded likewise by tul&rsquo;hh, sunt, and neb&rsquo;k-trees.&nbsp;
There we watered the cattle and filled our vessels. <a
name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a>&nbsp; In another half hour we rested for the
night, having made a march of nearly twelve hours, over more tiring ground
than that of yesterday.</p>
<p><i>&rsquo;Ain Weibeh</i> was to our right, which Robinson conjectured to
be Kadesh Barnea.</p>
<p>We perceived footprints of gazelles and of hyenas.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 5.&nbsp; Sunrise, Fahrenheit, 62&frac14;&deg;.&nbsp; Our
Jerusalem bread being now exhausted, we took to that of the desert-baking,
which is very good while fresh and hot from the stones on which the
improvisation of baking is performed, but not otherwise for a European
digestion: and our servants, with the Bedaween, had to chase the chickens
<!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>every morning.&nbsp; The survivors of those brought from
Jerusalem being humanely let out of their cages for feeding every evening,
the scene of running after them, or flinging cloaks in the air when they
took short flights, not to mention the shouts of the men and the screams of
the birds, was very ludicrous, but annoying, when time is precious.&nbsp;
The merry little Salem enjoyed all this, as well as the amusements of our
people, during the monotony of daily travelling: as, for instance, the
captain rolling oranges along the ground, as prizes for running, or his
mounting a camel himself, or riding backwards, etc.&mdash;anything for
variety.</p>
<p>The desert may be described as a dried pudding of sand and pebbles, in
different proportions in different places,&mdash;sometimes the sand
predominating, and sometimes the pebbles,&mdash;with occasionally an
abundance of very small fragments of flint, serving to give a firmer
consistency to the sand.&nbsp; Round boulders are also met with on
approaching the hill-sides.&nbsp; In one place large drifts of soft yellow
sand were wrinkled by the wind, as a smooth sea-beach is by the ripples of
a receding tide.&nbsp; These wrinkles, together with the glare of a burning
sun upon them, affected the eyes, so as to make the head giddy in passing
over them.</p>
<p>Wild flowers and shrubs are not wanting; and the former are often very
fragrant.&nbsp; I observed among those that are so, a prevalence in their
names of the letter &#1594; (gh); as Ghurrah, <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Ghubbeh, Ghurkud,
Ghuraim, etc.&nbsp; They brought me a handful of <i>meijainineh</i>, which
was said to be good for pains in the stomach; and the starry flower, called
<i>dibbaihh</i>, not unlike a wild pink, is eaten by the people, both
petals, calyx, and stalk.</p>
<p>The tul&rsquo;hh, or mimosa-tree, has a strange appearance, very like an
open fan, or the letter V filled up.</p>
<p>The green foliage of it is particularly vivid at the season when we saw
it, and the thorns long and sharp. <a name="citation304"></a><a
href="#footnote304" class="citation">[304]</a></p>
<p>Distances are hard to judge of in such <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>extensive plains and
in so clear an atmosphere.&nbsp; We had been nearly two days in sight of
Mount Hor, straight before us; yet the mountain only grew in size as we
approached it, not in distinctness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p305.jpg">
<img alt="Tul&rsquo;hh Trees" src="images/p305.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As we came nearer to the eastern mountains, we found innumerable and
huge blocks of porphyry rock scattered over the ground.&nbsp; The Arabs
called the range of Seir by the name of <i>Jebel Sherreh</i>.</p>
<p>At about eight hours from our last night&rsquo;s station, we turned off
the Wadi &rsquo;Arabah by the narrow <i>Wadi Tayibeh</i> into the heart of
the mountains, at the foot of Hor.</p>
<p>Ascended a series of precipices, and, at some elevation, met two young
English gentlemen, with a pair of double-barrelled pistols shared between
them, and their fingers ready on the triggers.&nbsp; They had a tale to
relate of grievous exactions made by the Fellahheen of Petra,&mdash;which,
however, seemed to me, by their account, to have been <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>brought on
unconsciously by themselves, in having taken an escort of Tiy&acirc;hah
Arabs from Nukh&rsquo;l instead of the Alaween; and they informed me that a
clergyman from Cambridge was still detained there, as he refused to comply
with the excessive demands of the people.</p>
<p>On what a stupendous scale is geology to be studied in Mount Seir, where
you have masses of red sandstone 1500 feet in depth; yellow sandstone
extending miles away in ranges of hills, and the sandy desert beneath; all
of this incapable of cultivation; and inspiring a sensation of deep
sadness, in connexion with the denunciations of God&rsquo;s prophecies!</p>
<p>At a quarter before four we caught the first glimpse of the Mez&acirc;r
of Aaron&rsquo;s tomb, and at five pitched our tents on the rugged side of
Hor, among crags and scented plants, enlivened by numerous cuckoos, and the
sweet warbling of one little bird.&nbsp; What reminiscences of dear old
England the song of the cuckoos awakened!&nbsp; Now, however, from
henceforth, being in England, their song will infallibly recall the memory
to large bare mountains, extreme heat of climate, and the fragrance of
Elijah&rsquo;s ret&rsquo;m plant.</p>
<p>During the last hour we had seen some blue pigeons, one partridge, and,
separately, two large eagles, to which our attention had been drawn by
their shadows moving on the ground before us; then, on looking upwards, the
royal birds were seen <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>sailing along, silently and slowly, against
the blue vault of ether.</p>
<p>This had been the hottest day of our whole journey; and the atmosphere
became thick as the evening stole over the hills.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sunrise, Fahrenheit 77&deg;.&nbsp; In the
morning we advanced upwards towards Aaron&rsquo;s tomb.&nbsp; Walking in
front of the luggage, we met the clergyman of whom we had heard the day
before.&nbsp; He had been allowed to leave Petra on suffering the people to
take money out of his pockets,&mdash;reserving to himself the intention of
complaining against them officially to the consul in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He had been to the summit of Hor, and pronounced the view from it to be
more grand and striking than that from Sinai.&nbsp; On bidding him
farewell, we took Sel&acirc;meh and one kaww&acirc;s, for clambering on our
hands and knees to the summit, leaving the luggage to proceed and wait for
us farther on; but had to rest occasionally in the shade of large trees of
&rsquo;Ar&acirc;r, which Robinson considered to be the true juniper, and
not the ret&rsquo;m.&nbsp; The latter (the <i>rothem</i> of the Hebrew
Bible, under which the Prophet Elijah reposed) was very abundant, and
covered with white blossom, shedding the richest perfume.&nbsp; Is it
possible that all this fragrance, and the warbling of the birds, is but
&ldquo;wasted in the desert air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain is all of dark-red colour; and the <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>higher we ascended,
the more difficult we found the progress to be.&nbsp; At length all farther
advance seemed impossible, till, on looking round, we observed an
excavation for a well, with masonry around it; and beyond this were steps
cut into the rock, which rock was sloped at an angle of between fifty and
sixty degrees.&nbsp; This encouraged us to persevere.</p>
<p>Still higher, I picked up some tesser&aelig; of mosaic, and morsels of
marble and alabaster,&mdash;a piece of the latter now lies on the table
before me.</p>
<p>At length we attained the highest peak, where there was scarcely more
space than sufficient to contain the small weli-building, which was at the
time untenanted, though we had expected to find a Moslem devotee in
permanent residence there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p308.jpg">
<img alt="Small weli-building" src="images/p308.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I utterly despair of being able to describe the prospect around us; and
can only say that extensive mountain-peaks lay in lines below, and might be
compared to those made upon embossed maps, but that the whole scene was
vast, savage, and abandoned to sombre desolation&mdash;both the hills and
the desert&mdash;in every direction.</p>
<p><!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>The atmosphere was too thick and hazy to allow of very distant
views.&nbsp; Neither of the two waters&mdash;the Red Sea or the Dead
Sea&mdash;was visible.</p>
<p>Let those who take pleasure in doing so, doubt that on that peak lies
interred Aaron, the first high priest of Israel, &ldquo;the saint of the
Lord,&rdquo; and that there was effected the first personal transfer of the
pontifical office from him to Eleazer his son.&nbsp; Rather let me believe
that there my unworthy footsteps have been placed on the same pieces of
rock with the two venerable brothers who led up the redeemed people from
Egypt, &ldquo;the house of bondage,&rdquo; and that it was there they
parted, leaving Moses to carry on the task alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Three Hebrew cradles, the Nile-palms under,<br />
&nbsp;  Rock&rsquo;d three sweet babes upon Egypt&rsquo;s plain:<br />
Three desert graves must those dear ones sunder,<br />
&nbsp;  Three sorrowful links of a broken chain.<br />
Kadesh and Hor, and Nebo yonder,<br />
&nbsp;  Three waymarks now for the pilgrim train.&rdquo; <a
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309"
class="citation">[309]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I seated myself, and wrote a brief letter to a dear relative in
England.</p>
<p>Entering the weli, we found near the door a common-looking tomb, with an
Arabic inscription,&mdash;which, however, I found too illegible to allow of
its being copied; and over the tomb was spread a pall of silk, striped in
red, green, and white, but much faded.&nbsp; Against a pillar, which
supports the roof, were hung rows of coloured rags and threads of yarn,
with snail-shells and sea-shells strung <!-- page 310--><a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>among them by way of
further ornament.&nbsp; A wooden bowl, at one end of the tomb, was probably
intended to receive alms for the support of the devotee who claims the
place, and who practises the curing of diseases by charms among the wild
Arabs.</p>
<p>The floor of the chamber has been handsomely paved with tesselated bits
of coloured marble, much of which still remains.&nbsp; Over the tomb are
suspended some ostrich eggs on a line, as is common in oriental churches;
and near it is a mihr&acirc;b, or niche in the wall, to indicate the
southerly direction for Moslem prayers.</p>
<p>In a corner of the floor, a flight of steps leads down to a crypt; and,
providing ourselves with a light, we descended thither, in expectation of
finding there the more ancient tomb, believed to be genuine, as it is the
usual practice in Moslem welies to have an imitation tomb on the common
floor at the entrance, while the true one is exactly beneath it.&nbsp; But
we only found an iron grating, swinging loose to the touch, and within it a
plain wall, from which part of the plaster having fallen away, allowed to
be seen the corner of a kind of stone sarcophagus.&nbsp; The portion
visible was not, however, sufficient to enable us to judge of its probable
era.&nbsp; The ceiling of the crypt is blackened by the smoke of lamps.</p>
<p>I then mounted, by the outside of the building, to the top of the dome,
but could see nothing <!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>thence of Petra, so deeply sunk is that valley
betwixt high hills.</p>
<p>Descending the mountain by the opposite side of that of our
arrival,&mdash;namely, on the side next to Petra,&mdash;we discovered that
more pains in roadmaking had been bestowed there, and that the ascent in
that direction would be comparatively easy.&nbsp; Cuckoos and partridges
were heard plentifully; and, on looking back, I saw a very large raven
hovering over the weli.</p>
<p>In an hour&rsquo;s descent we rejoined our servants and horses, but were
not yet at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Entering a valley of red rocks, much streaked with blue in wavy lines,
the first work of antiquity that met our view was a square turret on each
side of the road.&nbsp; Then we passed some tombs, or chambers, cut into
the massive red cliffs with architectural cornices, pediments, and
pilasters, some of them very handsome.&nbsp; Next was what Laborde marks in
his map as &ldquo;the solitary column.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is standing
solitary; but then near its base lie other columns of the same edifice,
with the circular slices (or <i>drums</i>, as architects term them) that
composed them, scarcely disturbed as they slid down in falling.</p>
<p>In five minutes more we halted for the night close to what Laborde
designates the Acropolis, where a pile of fine building lies prostrate, and
the columns on the ground, in their segments, still touching each
other.</p>
<p><!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>At the foot of this heap stands what is named the Palace of
Pharaoh; and our station within it appeared, from the black relics of fires
there, to be a frequent resting-place for travellers.</p>
<p>Here, then, we were fairly lodged among the wonders which so deservedly
excite the curiosity of the world, and proceeded to improve time, before
the Fellahheen of the district should arrive to annoy us, by crowding and
importunity.</p>
<p>It is not my design to recount in detail the marvels of the
place,&mdash;this has been done by Laborde, Lord Lindsay, Wilson, and
Robinson,&mdash;but just to say, that having with me the small edition of
Laborde and some manuscript notes extracted from other books, by their help
I saw most of what was to be seen.&nbsp; I wandered through streets of the
middle town; surveyed and entered palaces hewn into crimson rocks; sat
reading on the solid benches of the theatre, and walked along its stage;
then gazed with unwearied admiration on the beautiful Khazneh, its delicate
tints and graceful proportions, and went to rest upon a green bank opposite
to it, with a running stream at my feet, bordered by gorgeous oleanders,
where I chatted with some wild Arabs arriving from the south.&nbsp; Such a
harmony of ruddy tints, from the darkest buds of the oleander, through
gradations on the rocks, to the most delicate pink, was truly a feast of
nature for the eyes.</p>
<p>These are incidents never to be forgotten, and <!-- page 313--><a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>the memory of them is
unspeakably charming.&nbsp; I made a few rough sketches; but it may be
sufficient here to give only a specimen of the capitals of columns that are
peculiar to Petra.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p313.jpg">
<img alt="Capital of column" src="images/p313.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>During the afternoon the thermometer stood inside the tent at 95&deg;
Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The captain, my companion, went alone to explore the chasm called the
<i>Sik</i>, as my slight sprain, after being almost forgotten during the
journey, had become painful again from the effects of climbing upon Mount
Hor.</p>
<p>But I had come to Petra for business; and the indigenous peasantry of
Wadi Moosa were gathering around our tents from different directions.&nbsp;
They had not been prepared for the reception of guests arriving from the
north, <i>i.e.</i>, Jerusalem, as travellers usually come from
&rsquo;Akabah or Sinai, through Nukh&rsquo;l.</p>
<p><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>Our Arabs, both Jeh&acirc;leen and some strangers, set to making
themselves comfortable.&nbsp; There arrived a large body of the Fellahheen,
headed by Shaikh Sulim&acirc;n es Said, a ragged and ugly crew, he as dirty
as the rest, but strutting about in a robe of bright scarlet.</p>
<p>Then commenced the negotiations and disputes between them and ours;
noise and menace speedily ensued, alternated with diplomatic
man&oelig;uvres, for our champion, Sel&acirc;meh, was an able practitioner
in such matters, at least he had a reputation for it.&nbsp; The stormy
scenes were not concluded till late in the night, and they ended by an
arrangement that travellers, arriving by the new road from Jerusalem,
should pay the same pecuniary acknowledgment to the territorial owners as
had been hitherto claimed from those arriving under Alaween escort from
Nukh&rsquo;l or &rsquo;Akabah; and this agreement I ratified orally, as
writing or sealing would have been altogether out of place there.&nbsp; One
might think that so simple a matter could have been finished in five
minutes; but just as in European business of that nature, it is always
necessary for the contracting parties to be allowed scope for the display
of their professional talents.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sunrise, Fahrenheit
65&frac34;&deg;.&nbsp; An inundation of strange Arabs from the desert had
arrived during the night, and it was computed that there were not less than
two hundred guns round our tents, while our party had not more than five,
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>with a few pistols.&nbsp; We were hemmed in by the newcomers, and
the crags over us were occupied by men with guns laid in position between
crevices.&nbsp; Some men were scattered about, shooting at birds; but it
seemed to me their real object was rather the making of signals.</p>
<p>These people were &rsquo;Ali Rasheed&rsquo;s branch of the Alaween, from
a district not so distant as &rsquo;Akabah.&nbsp; Our Jeh&acirc;leen party
looked very insignificant among them; they had evidently not expected this
turn of events.</p>
<p>As soon as we Europeans showed ourselves after breakfast, the Fellahheen
rushed forward to serve as guides in exhibiting the curiosities.&nbsp;
Feeling rather lame, I decided on remaining at the tents with my two
kaww&acirc;ses as sentinels; the more disposed to do so, as the strangers
had, during the night, purloined some articles from the Jeh&acirc;leen.</p>
<p>It was a warm, misty morning, and in the absence of my companion I found
considerable amusement in the screams of multitudes of wild birds, high
aloft &ldquo;among the holes of the rocks, and the tops of the rugged
rocks,&rdquo;&mdash;probably all of them birds of prey,&mdash;which echoed
and reverberated with sounds closely resembling the laughter and shouts of
children in their vociferous games.&nbsp; On their return, the Fellahheen
were rapacious in demands for remuneration of their services, but were at
length contented.&nbsp; This was the signal for the others to take their
advantage.&nbsp; They wanted <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>toll to be paid for crossing part of the
desert on which they thought the Jeh&acirc;leen had no right or precedent
for bringing strangers.&nbsp; So, on our preparing to leave the ground,
they rushed up the bank, secured commanding points for their guns, and thus
exacted their fee.&nbsp; The screams and hubbub were at length terminated
by some small backsheesh, (to our surprise, how little was required,) and
we all marched away in a northern direction, the opposite to that of our
arrival.</p>
<p>This gave us an opportunity of passing again in front of the principal
edifices, if they may be so denominated, including what I had not before
seen, the sepulchre with the Latin inscription in large letters, QVINTVS.
PR&AElig;TEXTVS. FLORENTINVS.</p>
<p>It is to be noticed that Petra itself is called by the Arabs, Wadi
Phara&ocirc;n, <a name="citation316"></a><a href="#footnote316"
class="citation">[316]</a> not Wadi Moosa.&nbsp; The two valleys are
adjoining, but in the latter there are no antiquities or wonders.&nbsp; At
a distance, however, the journey to Petra is usually called a journey to
Wadi Moosa, because the Fellahheen of the region about there, and to whom
toll is paid, are cultivators of the Wadi Moosa.</p>
<p>Before leaving the place, it may be observed that the neighbourhood must
have been kept in a high <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>state of cultivation during the Roman empire
for the maintenance of so numerous and luxurious a population of the city,
instead of the absence of necessaries of civilised life that we now see
there; and that good state of things must have continued in later Christian
periods, when the district formed &ldquo;the third Palestine,&rdquo; and
deputed bishops to the synods of Jerusalem and elsewhere.</p>
<p>With respect to the colouring of the hills and rocks, it is truly
surprising to behold such huge masses of deep red colour, variegated with
wavy lines of violet and purple and blue, especially in the direction
towards Mount Hor.&nbsp; We did not, however, remark so much of yellow and
orange as Laborde or Irby and Mangles describe.</p>
<p>I find since that Dr Wilson states these rocks to be highly saliferous,
and says the Arabs scrape them with knives to obtain saltpetre for making
their rude gunpowder.&nbsp; He is of opinion that in some geological era
the whole place has been formed in a salt-water lake.&nbsp; Few people have
had so much leisure for making researches there as he had.</p>
<p>The temperature was high in the valley, because closely confined between
lines of hills; notwithstanding that the elevation is supposed to exceed
2000 feet above the Mediterranean.&nbsp; What it may be in a more advanced
season than April I cannot tell; but I perceived neither scorpions nor
serpents there, (as some represent the place to abound in,) no creeping
things worse than earwigs.</p>
<p><!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>When on the march, we learned that the robbery of the night by
&rsquo;Ali Rasheed&rsquo;s people, amounted to one camel, one gun, and old
Sel&acirc;meh&rsquo;s sandals.&nbsp; Also, that those three men whom we saw
on the 2d April at Abu Dahook&rsquo;s camp were of the same faction,
probably also my visitors of the Khazneh yesterday.&nbsp; Sel&acirc;meh
thought that for a couple of gazis (about three shillings and sixpence) he
might succeed in a redemption of his goods.&nbsp; These I gave him, and he
trudged back over the hills with one of his people, while we kept on our
way.&nbsp; He was to meet us at our night&rsquo;s station.</p>
<p>The last glance given to Petra showed us the palace of Pharaoh, and the
peak of Hor with Aaron&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>Our way led us over a tolerable plain, made agreeable by the fragrance
of the ret&rsquo;m, as wafted along by the breeze; this plant sometimes
almost covering the small branch valleys.</p>
<p>Soon after noon we were in the <i>Wadi Nemela</i>, through which we
travelled for nearly two hours,&mdash;a scene of broken rocks on each side,
and the intermediate space with a profusion of oleander, ret&rsquo;m and
&rsquo;ar&acirc;r, all in flower, some of the latter having trunks of ten
feet in circumference.</p>
<p>Thence we issued upon a heath covered with low fragrant herbs; our Arabs
singing, and the camels striding on famously, followed by a poor little
lamb that we had bought at Petra.&nbsp; This, of course, we did not intend
to convey all the way to Jerusalem; <!-- page 319--><a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>but his presence
constantly reminded me of the text, (Isa. xvi. 1,) &ldquo;Send ye the lamb
(to) the ruler of the land from Sela [<i>i.e.</i> Petra] to the wilderness,
unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is no longer the
time when the king of Moab paid tribute &ldquo;to the king of Israel,
100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams, with the wool,&rdquo; (2 Kings iii. 4.)</p>
<p>Soon after two <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we were passing over
ledges of porphyry mountain-cliffs, dark and gloomy, but enlivened by large
yellow salvia in bloom, and plenty of flowers visible in the hollow below;
the whole scene most romantic and fantastic in formation.&nbsp; Such huge
piles of porphyry I had not seen since those of the coast of Peterhead and
Buchan, lashed by the great billows coming from the Baltic Sea.&nbsp;
Occasionally we came to standing pools of water, which, lying on this hard
kind of stone, could not filter away or be absorbed, as in our Palestine
limestone would be the case.&nbsp; From these settlements our water vessels
were supplied.&nbsp; Thermometer in shade of a rocky cliff, 75&frac34;&deg;

<p>We were soon again upon sandstone cliffs, but wildly broken, and
descending into lower ground with its juniper and oleander.&nbsp; Then
ascended again, and attained our greatest elevation by half-past three, at
least equal to Robinson&rsquo;s calculation of 1500 feet above the
&rsquo;Arabah.&nbsp; For two hours more we had to traverse cliffs, gullies,
crags, and precipices of red porphyry or green syenite alternately, in
enormous masses, split by convulsions of <!-- page 320--><a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>nature, and next
arrived in a valley strewed with huge fragments, angular, not rounded
boulders, yet fallen from the adjacent mountains.&nbsp; But we were still

during our dinner, old Sel&acirc;meh rejoined us, having failed in his

said their object was to punish the Jeh&acirc;leen, for bringing travellers
through their country, instead of making them go by way of Egypt. <a

again at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; In half an hour we were clear of the
mountains of Seir or Edom; but for another hour the ground was still strewn
with blocks of porphyry and green syenite, too hard for any of our
implements to break off bits from them, and fragments small enough to be
carried away were very difficult to find; however, we got some.&nbsp; These
large stumbling-blocks, together with dry watercourses, rendered our
travelling unusually troublesome to the horses and camels, and wearisome to
ourselves.</p>
<p>At length we got upon the free &rsquo;Arabah, among green shrubs and
trees of tul&rsquo;hh and neb&rsquo;k.</p>
<p><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>At nine o&rsquo;clock we came to a high sandbank, beneath which
was a verdant line of tamarisk, and gh&acirc;r, and tall canes, with frogs
croaking among them.&nbsp; All of these were indications of water; and,
accordingly, we found a spring named <i>&rsquo;Ain Ta&auml;s&acirc;n</i>,
being one of those which together form the stream of
<i>Buwairdeh</i>.&nbsp; Here we filled our water vessels to the utmost, as
it was not expected we should find any more good water for two days to
come.</p>
<p>The surrounding prospect was one of utter desolation, and I took out my
Bible and read the words of 2 Kings iii. 8,-9, and 20: &ldquo;And he said,
Which way shall we go up?&nbsp; And he answered, The way through the
wilderness of Edom.&nbsp; So the king of Israel went, and the king of
Judah, and the king of Edom; and they fetched a compass of seven
days&rsquo; journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
cattle that followed them . . .&nbsp; And it came to pass in the morning,
when the meat-offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the
way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the spot, as well as at the present time, I remembered with pain the
deplorable weakness and wickedness of the remarks on this event contained
in Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age of Reason,&rdquo; and which I do not choose to
repeat.&nbsp; The most charitable opinion that one can entertain of such
writers is that they know nothing of the nature of the country under <!--
page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>consideration.&nbsp; Thank God that the world at large, and that
land in particular, is now better known than formerly, and, as a
consequence, our evidences of the truth of the blessed Bible are daily the
more confirmed.</p>
<p>We then proceeded northwards along the bed of that stream; but in a few
minutes its water was lost in the sand.&nbsp; In another hour we entered
the dry bed of the <i>Wadi el Jaib</i>, and continued along its course in
the direction of the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The hills were misty on both sides, and the ground hot beneath, as we
tramped along, all our voices hushed during the &ldquo;strength of the
heat,&rdquo; (according to Arab expression,) and the footfall of the camels
entirely without noise.</p>
<p>Who can sufficiently admire the adaptation of this creature to the
desert, in which the Maker and Ruler of all has placed him?&nbsp; No heat
exceeds the power of his endurance; steadily, patiently, silently he stalks
his long strides over the yellow ground&mdash;one animal following another
in regular military step.&nbsp; And during our travels at least he never
flagged&mdash;the large eyes never lost their brightness; and who ever saw
a camel, even though his master may seek rest or shade as he finds
opportunity, shrink from the blazing brightness of the sun?</p>
<p>Halted for the night shortly before five <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the journey having been one of eleven
hours.&nbsp; But the Arabs insisted on our being placed behind the corner
of a re-entering valley, in order that our fire <!-- page 323--><a

Mount Hor.</p>
<p>At a quarter to eight a breeze sprung up from the north, so refreshing
in that hot and dry wilderness as to merit the praise of the Bedawi poem,
beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Shem&acirc;li, ya hawa ed-deeret shem&acirc;li.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The north!&nbsp; O thou wind of the northern direction,<br />
It has increased my blessing, and all that belongs to me,<br />
And after weakness of state, has changed my condition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find, however, that this literal translation gives but a very poor
idea of the feeling concentrated in the words of the original, and only
feebly expresses the reminiscence of that time as still preserved at the
moment of this writing.</p>
<p>Soon after eight o&rsquo;clock we were out of the Wadi el Jaib, that is
to say, the high cliffs of marl on each side abruptly terminated, previous
to which, they had been at first more than a hundred feet above our heads,
and then gradually diminishing in height as we advanced.&nbsp; We descended
gradually into the semicircular expanse of marshes <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>called El Ghuwair or
the Little Gh&ocirc;r, with the large Dead Sea and the <i>Khash&rsquo;m
Usdum</i>, or salt mountain of Sodom, spread out before us.</p>
<p>The course of the wadi we had left trended from south-east to
north-east, on issuing from which we took the line on the western side of
the Ghuwair, and easily descended over small eminences.&nbsp; This place is
most probably the &ldquo;ascent of Akrabbim,&rdquo; (Num. xxxiv. 4, and
Josh. xv. 3,) the southern boundary of the land given to Israel, and named
after its abundance of scorpions.&nbsp; In our hasty passage over it we saw
none of these.</p>
<p>Among the marshes we found several palms growing wild.&nbsp; They were
stumpy in stature, and ragged in form for want of cultivation, or perhaps
of congenial soil.&nbsp; The miasma was strongly perceptible to the smell,
and our horses were plagued with flies and gnats.&nbsp; How great was this
change from the pure dry air of the mountains!</p>
<p>Quarter to ten at <i>&rsquo;Ain &rsquo;Aroos</i>, (the
bridegroom&rsquo;s fountain,) but the water was brackish.</p>
<p>Thermometer in the shade, 83&frac12;&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>For an hour past our people had been on the alert, on account of a feud
between them and the Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs.&nbsp; On coming up to the
print of a human footstep, this was carefully examined as to its size,
direction of the tread, etc.&nbsp; The circumstances were not, however,
exactly parallel to the occurrence in Robinson Crusoe, which naturally came
to mind.</p>
<p><!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>At twenty minutes to eleven, having completed the western curve
of the Ghuwair, we fell in with the <i>Wadi Hhuggereh</i>, which came up
from the south-west, and on looking back, perceived a distinct mirage
visible over the dry sands which occupy part of the Ghuwair, probably the
effect of a salty deposit.</p>
<p>About noon we arrived at a clear, running stream of water, but which
proved, on tasting, to be highly impregnated with salt.&nbsp; The surface
of the plain was in a great measure covered with a white
efflorescence.&nbsp; Along the middle of this plain there was a sunken
channel of a mile and a half in length, occupied by an overflowing of the
Dead Sea, which, however, did not interfere with our track.</p>
<p>At the end of this, and on approaching the corner of the salt mountain,
we had an <i>incident</i> to enliven the tediousness of the hot
journey.&nbsp; A party of Arabs came in sight.&nbsp; Our men discovered
them first, and running forwards, primed their guns, or lighted the match
of the lock, drew their swords and screamed, making bare the right arm, as
if prepared for awful deeds.&nbsp; The others took up position behind low
rocks, unslung their fire-arms, and screamed <i>not</i>.&nbsp; Presently a
real or fictitious recognition took place, the guns on both sides were
fired up in the air, and swords were brandished for very joy.&nbsp; Both
parties rushed into each other&rsquo;s embraces, smiling and kissing with
the greatest fervour.</p>
<p>The comers proved to be some of their own <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>Jeh&acirc;leen,
escorting some Hebron townsmen to Kerak.&nbsp; There were two women among
the latter, some old men, and some conjurers with monkeys, who thereupon
set up a dance to the music of tambourines.&nbsp; Upon something like
equanimity being restored, the strangers informed us of certain doings that
had taken place, on our account, since we had passed by there, and which
nearly concerned us.</p>
<p>The two parties soon separated, taking opposite directions.</p>
<p>As we were close upon the western side, there was the southern end of
the Dead Sea at our right hand, coming up imperceptibly upon the land,
flush with it, so that no limit could be distinguished between water and
the wet beach.</p>
<p>At a few minutes past one we all alighted before the large cavern which
runs into the heart of the salt mountain; and a picturesque group our party
formed, spread about in some shade of the hill, with a great variety of
costumes and colours&mdash;the camels kneeling and the horses picketed upon
the bay of the sea of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>Entering the cavern, we found relics of the recent French expedition
thither, under M. de Saulcy, such as egg-shells and torn paper coverings of
candles, with French shopkeepers&rsquo; names upon them.&nbsp; We did not
penetrate far inwards, but could see traces of occasional overflowings of
the lake into the interior.</p>
<p><!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>The mountain itself is a wonder: five miles of salt above ground,
and a hundred feet, probably in some places two hundred feet high.&nbsp;
The colour is not bright, but of a dull gray.&nbsp; The best parts of it
are very hard to break, and with difficulty we brought away some pieces for
curiosity.</p>
<p>As for Lot&rsquo;s wife,&mdash;the pillar of salt, mentioned and
portrayed by the American expedition in 1848, and of which it is said they
took a fragment for a museum at home,&mdash;after a good deal of search, we
only discovered a crooked thin spire of rock-salt in one place of the
mountain; but it would not have been very remarkable if many such had been
found to exist in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>It was a place for inducing solemn reflections and intense sensations,
such as one could hardly venture to record at the time of being there, or
endeavour to repeat now after so long an interval.&nbsp; Much may, however,
be imagined by devout readers of the holy Scriptures&mdash;not only as
contained in the records of the Book of Genesis, but also as inculcated
with intense emphasis in the Epistle of Jude in a later period.&nbsp;
Still, there is a vividness of impression to be derived only from being
actually on the spot, and surveying the huge extent of water that differs
from any other in the world,&mdash;placid and bright on its surface, yet
awful in its rocky boundaries.&nbsp; But where are the cities and their
punished inhabitants, except in the Bible, and the traditions preserved by
Tacitus, the <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>Kor&acirc;n, and by the present inhabitants of the country?</p>
<p>Some morsels of bitumen were found upon the beach; but the principal
season of the year for finding it is in winter, especially at the
commencement of winter, when the lake becomes unusually agitated, and
breaks off masses of it from the bottom, often of very large size&mdash;the
peasants of Hebron, with exaggeration, say, &ldquo;As large as
ships;&rdquo; but I have seen many camel-loads of it brought up to
Jerusalem at a time, for export to Europe.&nbsp; It is, however, a monopoly
of the crown.</p>
<p>We should note that in Gen. xiv. 10, the district was full of bitumen
pits previous to the overthrow of the cities of the plain.</p>
<p>At twenty minutes to three we came to a rude heap of stones called
<i>Zoghal</i> or <i>Zoghar</i>.&nbsp; This cannot well be Zoar, among other
reasons, because it lies upon the beach, and is not upon an eminence.&nbsp;
It is well to mention that M. de Saulcy&rsquo;s extravagant ideas of the
Pentapolis of Sodom, etc., had not then been published.</p>
<p>In another quarter of an hour we had reached the extremity of the
&ldquo;Salt Mountain,&rdquo; with all its distorted, sometimes even
perpendicular stratification.&nbsp; By this time we were convinced that the
whole of the mountain is not salt, but that a good deal of the upper length
of it is a mixture of salt and marl or sand.&nbsp; Between it and the
water&rsquo;s <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>edge we frequently saw blocks and spires of
rock-salt protruding through the flat beach.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the Arabic name, <i>Usdum</i>, is identical
with Sodom, by a well-known custom of the language to invert the consonant
and vowel of the first syllable.&nbsp; But even this is brought back to the
original state in the adjective form.&nbsp; Thus I heard our guides speak
of the Jebel Sid&rsquo;mi, meaning the Khash&rsquo;m or Jebel Usdum, or
promontory of Sodom.</p>
<p>The <i>Wadi Netheeleh</i> comes up from the southwest to the shore at
this northern end of the mountain, parallel to the Wadi Hhuggereh at the
southern end.</p>
<p>We kept along the sea-side, and on rising to a higher level, near five
o&rsquo;clock, halted for the night at the mouth of a valley where some
water was to be procured, and near us was a broken tower.&nbsp; This site
is named <i>Mobugghek</i> or <i>Umm-Bugghek</i>.&nbsp; As we were scarcely
out of the reach of the Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs, our people had to go out in
armed detachments for collecting firewood.</p>
<p>During the process of pitching the tents, one of our men, named
&rsquo;Odeh, perceived a stranger at a great distance, and half stripping
himself, ran nimbly up a steep sand hill, ready for whatever operation
might be necessary.&nbsp; Our European, I might rather say, our civilised
eyes, could not have discovered the ill-omened object at that distance, but
those of desert Arabs are far more powerful <!-- page 330--><a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>than ours.&nbsp; I do
not know that I shall ever forget the ardent brilliancy of Shaikh
Sel&acirc;meh&rsquo;s eyes at all times, as witnessed constantly during our
excursion.</p>
<p>While we rambled on the beach in search of bitumen or sulphur, we
suddenly heard a furious screaming in the direction of our tents, and
hastily returning, found a number of strangers coming down a winding
path.&nbsp; Our men were gathered together, and armed.&nbsp; The captain
also examined the state of his double-barrelled pistols.&nbsp; However, on
their arrival, the newcomers were recognised as people <i>not hostile</i>
to the Jeh&acirc;leen, and their general location is near &rsquo;Ain
&rsquo;Aroos.&nbsp; So, after some squabbling and arrangement, they agreed
to share our supper with us in peace.&nbsp; Had the case been otherwise,
our position was not an enviable one; for we were shut in between their
hills and the sea, they were more numerous than our Arabs, and they had
entire command of our spring of water.&nbsp; Our camels, too, were all
unloaded, and the packages scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>The scenery was desolate and gloomy in the extreme, undoubtedly blasted
by the wrath of Almighty God, although a place which had at one time been
&ldquo;well watered everywhere . . . even as the garden of the Lord, like
the land of Egypt,&rdquo; (Gen. xiii. 10;) and it required strong faith to
expect the possibility of this &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo;
(<i>&rsquo;Arabah</i>) being again made &ldquo;like Eden, and her desert
like the garden of the Lord,&rdquo; (Isa. li. 3.)&nbsp; Indeed, that <!--
page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>promise
does not seem to apply to this peculiar locality, by comparing it with
Ezek. xlvii. 10, 11, although these unwholesome waters are to be healed,
and are to have fish of various kinds in them, with fishermen&rsquo;s nets
employed there.</p>
<p>It deserves observation, that now the sea is so utterly lifeless that
the American explorers there were unable, by the most powerful microscopes,
to find any animalcul&aelig; in its water.&nbsp; Yet Lynch was of opinion
that the atmosphere or vapour there was not in any way prejudicial to human
health; and since then, Mr Holman Hunt spent a considerable time near the
brink without injury derived from it.</p>
<p>The air was very warm all night, with no freshening dew, and the sound
of slow, rippling water on the strand, during the still starlight hours,
was one to which our ears had not been of late accustomed.</p>
<p>The Arab figures and conversation round the watch-fire were romantic
enough.&nbsp; Thermometer at eight <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,

70&frac14;&deg;.&nbsp; In taking this last note of the thermometer at
sunrise, I may observe that the marking of it at that moment gives but a
feeble idea of the heat that we experienced during the days&rsquo; marches
throughout this excursion,&mdash;the temperature rapidly increased after
sunrise, and at later hours within the confined hollows, such as Petra and
the basin of the Dead Sea, rose to that of (I suppose) an Indian
climate&mdash;but above all the effects of heat <!-- page 332--><a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>was that produced by
the weight of atmospheric pressure at probably the lowest position in the
whole surface of the globe: about 1300 feet below the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Before six o&rsquo;clock we were on the march, over broken and
precipitous rocky paths, on which the progress was slow and toilsome.&nbsp;
Then down again upon the beach.&nbsp; I am sure that if the Dead Sea were
already covering the ground that it now does, before the time of
Chedorlaomer, the &ldquo;four kings against five&rdquo; could not possibly
have mustered or man&oelig;uvred their armies on any side or place between
the mountains on each side of the water. <a name="citation332"></a><a
href="#footnote332" class="citation">[332]</a>&nbsp; At a quarter past
seven the thermometer stood at 86&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>There is always a close, heavy heat in this depressed region, inducing
profuse perspiration.</p>
<p>At ten minutes past nine we were at the spot where the great eastern
peninsula projects nearest to us, having in view the two extremities,
north-east and south-west, now named on the maps, the former as Point
Costigan, after the unfortunate explorer of 1835, and the latter, Point
Molyneux, after my friend, the lieutenant of H.M.S. <i>Spartan</i>, who was
there in 1847.&nbsp; But at that season of the year we could perceive no
traces of the shallow or <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>ford by which the Arabs occasionally pass over
to it on the way to Kerak.</p>
<p>At half-past nine we were in front of <i>Sebbeh</i>, with a view of the
ruins of Masada on its summit, to which, however, we did not climb, but
contented ourselves with recalling to memory the heroic events of the
Jewish defenders, as related by Josephus.&nbsp; Here the sea, retiring
towards our side, forms a semicircular bay, terminating at <i>&rsquo;Ain
Jidi</i>, (Engeddi,) where we arrived at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There we
were at a considerable elevation above the shore, which we now abandoned,
not only because all further advance in that direction is impracticable,
but because our route towards Jerusalem lay in a different direction.</p>
<p>We were upon a platform abounding in springs of water and luxuriant
neglected vegetation.&nbsp; The pleasure derived from the sound of gushing
streams can only be appreciated by those who have been in our
circumstances.&nbsp; The contrast is not to be understood merely from words
laid before a reader, between this and the dry wilderness of Edom or the
salt beach of Sodom.&nbsp; One of our camels not only drank his fill, but
rolled himself in the water.</p>
<p>There were some neb&rsquo;k trees, some trees of the
<i>&rsquo;osher</i>, (apple of Sodom,) and some of the shrub <i>solanum
melongena</i>, all of which may be found near Jericho, though not peculiar
to that region.&nbsp; Canes and large weeds almost filled the watercourses,
<!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>but not a blossom of any wild-flower could I find upon the
ground.</p>
<p>The streams abound in petrifactions of vegetation, which would show that
the water cannot be very wholesome for drinking.&nbsp; A monster crab was
brought us out of a channel; my horse in drinking had been startled at the
sight of it.</p>
<p>There were traces of buildings about the place, such as foundations of
walls almost razed to the ground, and one broken tower.</p>
<p>But the prospect eastwards, including the peninsula, and the mountains
and huge crevasses of Moab, or southwards, including Sebbeh and the Salt
mountain, are magnificent beyond expression.&nbsp; We could not be sure
that Mount Hor was distinguishable.&nbsp; At a quarter past three, and
under shade of trees, the thermometer was at 86&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>After considerable repose and some feeding there, we prepared for the
remaining ascent, called by our people &ldquo;The Ladder of
<i>Ter&acirc;beh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a very toilsome climbing of
near two hours up a nearly perpendicular cliff, by means of curves and
zigzags turning away four or five yards.&nbsp; Most of the way we were
dismounted, but still the horses and camels were greatly distressed by the
effort of the ascent.&nbsp; At first the camel-drivers sang to cheer their
animals.&nbsp; This, however, dwindled into occasional prolonged notes,
which again were deteriorated into groans instead of music.</p>
<p>It was a curious sight for us who were untroubled <!-- page 335--><a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>with the care of
camels, and consequently getting on faster than they, to look down upon the
wavy lines of moving creatures, and hear the echoes of their voices from
below.</p>
<p>Reached the summit at half-past four, and after an hour&rsquo;s progress
upon level ground, we halted for the night.&nbsp; Poor old Sel&acirc;meh
fell down flat, not so much from the effect of mere fatigue, as from having
had his ankle bitten by a spiteful camel in the morning, and then the long
climbing in addition.</p>
<p>This was to be our last night together, and we enjoyed to the utmost the
social gathering round the bivouac fire with our Arab companions, to whom,
after ten days association, to the exclusion of all the rest of the world,
we could not but feel something of temporary personal attachment.&nbsp;
There was Sel&acirc;meh, with his mended shoe and his bitten ankle, who had
been our officer and diplomatist, ready for fun or a row at any minute;
&rsquo;Odeh the champion, called out upon emergencies; Khamees, the slave
boy, a general domestic, if this latter word may be allowed for a Bedawi
Arab; and Salem the merry-man, short in stature, and drawing into the vale
of years.&nbsp; We chatted over the fire about the events of the
expedition, while some of the men were kneading and baking fresh bread upon
stones made hot in the fire.</p>
<p>Yet this is a sad aimless life that such people lead&mdash;of course our
excursion under their <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>protection was an event to supply matter for
many a conversation afterwards.</p>
<p>As for religion: they seem to have little or no sense of its
responsibility or benefit, or even its formalities.&nbsp; I asked
Sel&acirc;meh about prayers or reading, and all he had to say was that
annually in Ramadan they hire a reader from some mosque of a town to come
and read the Kor&acirc;n to them; but not one, not even Abu Dahook could
read for himself.&nbsp; I never heard these Jeh&acirc;leen mention either
the word <i>Moslem</i> or <i>Ghiaour</i>, much less the technical words
<i>Mushrakeen</i> or <i>Seerat el Mustakeem</i>.&nbsp; Thermometer at
sunset, 79&frac14;&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><i>April</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our camels were loaded for the last
time, as usual grunting, groaning, and tossing the head backwards while the
burdens were placed upon them, and, as must be known to all desert
travellers, the smell exhaled from these animals after a long journey is
particularly disagreeable.</p>
<p>We were marching forward at half-past five, and in an hour and a half we
caught a distant view of our old familiar Frank mountain, which was lost
again afterwards.&nbsp; About ten o&rsquo;clock, we saw in a valley at our
left an encampment of Sa&iuml;r Arabs; and soon afterwards in a valley at
our right, a circle of the Ta&rsquo;amri tents.&nbsp; In another hour we
arrived at a square enclosure of very large ancient stones, which was
denominated <i>&rsquo;Arkoob Sah&acirc;ba</i>.&nbsp; The breezes on this
high land were most refreshing after our southern excursion.</p>

distance forwards, to the north-east, some ruins called
<i>Abu&rsquo;n-jaib</i>, or perhaps Abu N&rsquo;jaim.</p>
<p>Then we approached the well-remembered fragrance of the wild herbs on
the uncultivated hills about Urtas and Bethlehem, redolent of homeward
associations, and between two and three o&rsquo;clock were at Jerusalem,
grateful for special and numerous mercies of Divine Providence.</p>
<p>Jewish friends were much interested in my report of Aaron&rsquo;s tomb
on Mount Hor, and regarded it as a great achievement to have visited and
returned from &ldquo;Joktheel,&rdquo; as they called Petra, in compliance
with 2 Kings xiv. 7, where King Amaziah restored its more ancient name from
<i>Selah</i>, (see Joshua xv. 38.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In conclusion of this expedition to Petra, I have a few observations to
make, arising from local peculiarities connected with it.</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; <i>On the payment of toll</i>, <i>or Ghuf&rsquo;r</i>, <i>as it
is termed</i>, <i>for traversing unfrequented districts</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, this custom could never obtain in a country enjoying the
benefits of a vigorous central government; but it is, and perhaps always
has been, common in the far East.&nbsp; In Persia or Tartary, wherever a
chief is able to lay hold of a tower, and collect around him a band of
followers, he invariably exacts this tribute from strangers; just as in our
middle ages of Europe was done by <!-- page 338--><a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>the same class of
persons in countries where feudal institutions prevailed.&nbsp; The petty
barons were the shaikhs of their place and period.</p>
<p>But some considerations may serve to show that there is, after all,
something useful in the practice.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In such countries, the payment of this toll exempts the
traveller from the violence of all other claimants.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Those who get the toll, (I speak now of Palestine,) are always
ready to perform small services in return, which would be assuredly missed
if omitted, independently of the price paid for hire of camels.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If there were a better government existing, the traveller would
expect that government to provide good roads and bridges, and to establish
military posts for guarding them.&nbsp; This expense would be defrayed from
tolls, or some such mode of taxation, and so the fee or duty would be only
removed from one receiver to another.&nbsp; This is done at present, and
probably has been for many centuries, at the <i>Jis&rsquo;r ben&acirc;t
Ya&rsquo;koob</i>, between Safed and Damascus.</p>
<p>One cannot be surprised at the peasantry of Wadi Moosa exacting a toll
from travellers on entering the valley of Petra, to see the wonders of
antiquity which are attracting the attention of the most remote nations;
remembering, too, the position of the place, viz., in a hollow, surrounded
by <!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>crags and hills, where no Turkish rulers have ever been.</p>
<p>In like manner, we shall only be in a condition to remonstrate on paying
ghuf&rsquo;r in the shape of presents to the Adwan beyond Jordan, when we
are able to find our way to Amm&acirc;n and Jerash without them, or to keep
off the Beni Sukh&rsquo;r and &rsquo;Anezeh, either by our own right hand
or by means of the Turks. <a name="citation339"></a><a href="#footnote339"
class="citation">[339]</a></p>
<p>Finally, it must be borne in mind that the Turkish government itself
pays ghuf&rsquo;r to the Eastern Bedaween for allowing the Hadj pilgrims to
pass from Damascus to Mecca.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; <i>On the Fellahheen</i>, <i>or peasants of Wadi Moosa</i>.</p>
<p>The most experienced travellers that have visited Petra, have remarked
that these men are of a different race from the Bedaween Arabs around
them.&nbsp; They are ugly, bad in expression of countenance, and have a
reputation for cruelty and treachery.</p>
<p>Laborde says, that the Alaween looked upon them &ldquo;with contempt
<i>and fear</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Lindsay says, that Shaikh Hhussain, from
&rsquo;Akabah, &ldquo;was <i>in fear</i> all the time of being
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Irby and Mangles were told by the Jeh&acirc;leen that
these <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>Fellahheen murdered thirty Moslem pilgrims from Barbary, the year
before their visit.</p>
<p>Dr Wilson stayed among them longer, I believe, than any other European,
and he did not like them, yet found them gradually improve under civil
treatment, which always, like some other things,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He divides them into two classes as cultivators of land.&nbsp; First,
Those residing in a village called <i>Eljy</i>; and, second, Those residing
in tents under one Abu Zeitoon.</p>
<p>He describes them as a very exclusive people, never intermarrying with
Arabs, nor burying in common grounds with them; and having a different set
of personal names among them from those used by Arabs, which names greatly
resemble those found in the Old Testament Scriptures.</p>
<p>He concludes that they are descendants of the ancient Edomites.</p>
<p>A most remarkable circumstance that he observed, was their calling
themselves children of Israel, (Beni Isra&iuml;n.)&nbsp; This he regards as
a feeble traditional reminiscence of their proselytism to the faith of
Israel by the sword of the Maccab&aelig;an conquerors.</p>
<p>For my own part, I distinctly aver that during the altercation upon my
arrival there, between them and my Jeh&acirc;leen, I did hear the words
&ldquo;children of Israel&rdquo; used.&nbsp; I had not chosen to take a
part in the conference, or to remain long at a time <!-- page 341--><a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>among the disputants,
but only passed occasionally in and out of the tent, and my mind was
chiefly engrossed with the subject-matter in hand, so that on hearing the
words, &ldquo;children of Israel,&rdquo; I thought they were alluding to
some history or tradition of the Hebrew people.&nbsp; But afterwards, on
connecting the fact with Dr Wilson&rsquo;s assertion, I cannot but consider
it very remarkable.</p>
<p>But the whole subject of these Fellahheen seems to merit closer
attention from those who have the leisure and opportunity for it.</p>
<p>I know that numerous travellers, including ladies, have been there in
safety; and it is probable that some of the disputes which have arisen were
occasioned either through ignorance, or from insolence of the
dragomans.&nbsp; It would be interesting to compare the accounts of those
who have suffered annoyances in Petra, so as to ascertain how far the
Fellahheen were to blame, or whether difficulties are not rather due to the
Arab tribes who are in the habit of tyrannising over the Fellahheen from
the outside.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; <i>On the &rsquo;Arabah and the Dead Sea</i>.</p>
<p>While on the spot, I had wished to believe in the theory of Leake in
1822, and afterwards turned almost into poetry by Lord Lindsay,
notwithstanding the demonstrations of Bertou in 1838, and of the American
expedition of 1848, namely, that the Jordan formerly flowed the whole
length from the Anti-Lebanon to the Red Sea, and that the <!-- page
342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>Asphaltite
Lake, or Dead Sea, is only formed by a stoppage of its stream.</p>
<p>Two facts, however, which militate against this theory, were visible to
our eyes on this journey.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the valleys south of the Dead Sea all point towards it,
and incline the slope of their beds in that direction.&nbsp; This was most
particularly the case with the Wadi el Jaib, where the banks between which
the torrents had cut a channel became higher, which is equivalent to saying
that the water fell lower as it passed northwards.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That wherever there were trees or shrubs to arrest the currents
of water, we found that all the rushes, thorns, or reeds carried on by the
streams, were arrested on the south side of those trees, and there they
remained in the dry season.</p>
<p>The course of the torrents was therefore from the south, towards the
Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The best dissertation on the relative levels of lands and seas, bearing
on this subject, and that which I believe to be exhaustive on the subject,
till we get more of scientific realities, is contained in vol. xviii., part
2, of the Royal Geographical Society&rsquo;s Journal of 1848.</p>
<p>Still, allowing the facts that I myself observed, as well as all the
scientific calculations in the Journal above referred to, (indeed, making
use of them,) there seem to remain certain considerations undisposed of, in
favour of the theory that the Jordan formerly ran into the Red Sea.</p>
<p><!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>1.&nbsp; The &rsquo;Arabah, south of the Dead Sea, and the
Gh&ocirc;r on its north, are one continued hollow between the same parallel
lines of hills; and Robinson has shown that by the Arabian geographers they
are both called the &rsquo;Arabah; the native Arabs also still call by the
name of Ghuwair, or little Gh&ocirc;r, a space at the southern extremity of
the water.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew Bible also, the northern part is called &rsquo;Arabah, as
in Joshua iii. 16, where it is said the Israelites crossed &ldquo;the sea
of &rsquo;Arabah, namely, the sea of salt.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 2 Sam. iv. 7,
the murderers of Ish-bosheth went all night from Mahanaim to Hebron along
the &rsquo;Arabah, this was clearly not south of the Dead Sea.&nbsp; Josh.
xii. i., &ldquo;From the river Arnon to mount Hermon, and all the
&rsquo;Arabah on the east,&rdquo; going northwards; this is explained in
the 3d verse as &ldquo;the &rsquo;Arabah, (beginning at Hermon,) unto the
sea of Chinnereth, (sea of Tiberias) on the east, and unto the sea of the
&rsquo;Arabah, the sea of salt, on the east.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same words
occur also in Deut. iii. 17, and iv. 49.&nbsp; That the present Arab
&rsquo;Arabah on the south of the Dead Sea bore the same name, may be seen
in Deut. ii. 8, where Moses speaks of &ldquo;the way of the
&lsquo;&rsquo;Arabah&rsquo; from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, according to Hebrew and Arabic authorities, the &rsquo;Arabah
and Gh&ocirc;r form one line from the Lebanon to the Red Sea.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Book of Job takes cognisance of the <!-- page 344--><a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>river Jordan, and
describes river scenery in the land of Edom, <i>i.e.</i>, south of the Dead
Sea.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No lake existed in that locality before the catastrophe of
Sodom, although a river may have traversed it.&nbsp; This I deduce from the
march of the army of Chedorlaomer, shortly previous to that catastrophe,
(Gen. xiv.)&nbsp; After the taking of Seir and Paran, he crossed the valley
to Hazezon-Tamar, which is Engedi, (2 Chron. xx. 2,) and the confederates
were met by the kings of the plain in the vale of Siddim.&nbsp; And I have
heretofore shown that this is utterly impossible to be done with the
present lake in the way.&nbsp; The words, therefore, of Gen. xiv. 3
obviously signify, as given in the Latin Vulgate and in Luther&rsquo;s
German, &ldquo;the vale of Siddim, which is <i>now</i> the Salt
Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inference from all these points is, that between the time of
Chedorlaomer and Moses, some tellural convulsions took place which impeded
the course of the river towards the Dead Sea, and thereby formed the
present lake.&nbsp; There is no mention of a river in the lower
&rsquo;Arabah during the wanderings of the Israelites under the leading of
Moses.</p>
<p>It is another matter to discuss whether the overthrow of the guilty
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah is connected with that convulsion of nature,
with or without miracle, which formed the depression of the great valley;
yet it is remarkable that the deepest part of the lake is at the spot which
<!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>tradition has always pointed out for the site of those cities,
and nigh to the salt mountain, which still bears the name of Sodom.</p>
<p>To this spot the slopes both ways tend, and there they meet.&nbsp;
Calculating the whole line of depression, as Petermann does, at 190 miles,
the slope from the north, <i>i.e.</i>, from the &ldquo;Bridge of the
daughters of Jacob,&rdquo; near Safed, is comparatively gradual for 140
miles; and that from the south, <i>i.e.</i>, from the elevation in the
southern &rsquo;Arabah, where the level meets again from the north, is more
precipitous for 50 miles.&nbsp; Action and reaction being equal in natural
effects, the rapid declivity in the shorter distance is equal to the more
gradual declivity in the longer measure.</p>
<p>But that centre of <i>seismal action</i> is taken for the site of
Sodom&mdash;hence the site of the destruction of Sodom and the starting
point of earthquake are the same.&nbsp; The record of the destruction is,
therefore, the record of some dreadful convulsion capable of stopping the
Jordan, so as to form a lake there; and the only <i>adequate</i> cause in
nature assigned by geologists for such a depression, is earthquake
accompanied by volcanic action.</p>
<p>While on the subject of possible depression of the Jordan bed, I may
mention an indication which I have often pointed out to others, namely, the
remarkable ledge traceable along the face of the Moab mountains at a
considerable height, as seen from the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.&nbsp;
<!-- page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>It
is distinctly marked, and forms a curious record of some natural change
having occurred on a large scale.</p>
<p>Dr Wilson, in his &ldquo;Lands of the Bible,&rdquo; contends that an
earthquake capable of depressing a straight line of the length of the
Gh&ocirc;r and &rsquo;Arabah, must have convulsed all the lands of Canaan,
Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the Desert, with their inhabitants; but that no such
convulsion took place, for Zoar on the east, and Hebron on the west, are
known to have remained.</p>
<p>Does it, however, necessarily follow that seismal devastation spreads in
<i>every</i> direction?&nbsp; On the contrary, earthquakes act in
oscillations from east to west, returning from west to east; or from north
to south, returning from south to north: but not in the manner of a flood
of water spreading in every direction at once.&nbsp; If so, a mighty
earthquake, extending along the whole Gh&ocirc;r and &rsquo;Arabah, would
be exactly such a cause as might spare a city on each side of its
progress.</p>
<p>The whole subject still admits of much careful investigation on sundry
points; but, meanwhile, until geologists have given us more data from which
to form conclusions, I must take my stand upon the distinct record of
Genesis; that what was the Salt Sea when Moses wrote, had been the Vale or
Plain (Emek) of Siddim, containing cities with kings, who fought and were
subdued by Chedarlaomer upon that plain in the time of Abraham; and that
those cities were the same as those that were penally destroyed soon
after.</p>

347</span>XII.&nbsp; ACROSS THE LEBANON.</h2>
<p>I have traversed the Lebanon eastwards and southwards of Bayroot several
times; once in 1849; again in 1853; and also in 1855: but it seems
advisable to narrate the incidents separately, and although on two
occasions I passed over nearly the same ground, it will be curious to
compare or contrast those journeys, inasmuch as the circumstances were
dissimilar.</p>
<p>PART I.&mdash;1849.</p>
<p>The course of the first journey was as follows:&mdash;From Sidon on the
sea-coast we gradually climbed the Lebanon range eastward; then descending
by tortuous roads, and turning somewhat to the south, we crossed to where
Hhasbeya lies at the foot of Anti-Lebanon; after which we followed the
general direction of the streams southwards, and uniting above the waters
of Merom form the Jordan.&nbsp; Holding on at the western side of the plain
we arrived at Safed in Galilee.</p>
<p><!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span><i>Oct.</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;We left Saida for Joon, which had
been for many years the residence of Lady Hester Stanhope, and the
vice-consul furnished us with a kaww&acirc;s who had been a servant of her
ladyship.</p>
<p>Turned off from the high road of the sea-coast, at the river Awali,
which is believed by the native Christians to have been the limit of our
Lord&rsquo;s ministry on earth, when it is said that He went into
&ldquo;the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We outflanked the rich scene of fruit plantations belonging to the town,
but picked blackberries, hips, and haws, from their hedges alongside the
runnels of water which supply those gardens.</p>
<p>On its approach to the sea the river Awali has two separate channels,
along either of which it flows in different years, according to the volume
of water at the beginning of winter, but never in both at the same
time.</p>
<p>Through lovely scenery we gradually mounted higher and higher, till
arriving at the village of <i>Joon</i>, where rooms were to be prepared for
us in a native house.</p>
<p>The nature of the district thereabout is that of numerous round hills,
separated from each other by deep valleys.&nbsp; On one of these hills
stands the village, on another the large &ldquo;Convent of the
Saviour,&rdquo; (Dair el Mokhallis,) which is the central station of the
Greek Catholic sect; <i>i.e.</i>, of those who, while retaining their
Oriental rites and calendar, acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope <!--
page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>of
Rome; and on the third hill is Lady Hester Stanhope&rsquo;s house, the
three forming the points of nearly an equilateral triangle.&nbsp; The
village commands a fine prospect of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Without dismounting, we proceeded at once to the desolate house of Lady
Hester, but, owing to the precipitous nature of the ground, it takes some
considerable time to reach it, yet voices are easily distinguishable from
one place to the other.</p>
<p>The house presents a melancholy spectacle, though, from the purity of
the atmosphere, the walls appear clean and almost new; no roof remains, all
timbers having been purposely removed immediately after her death,
according to legal right of the proprietor from whom the place was
rented.&nbsp; There has been an extensive suite of rooms, not adapted to
stateliness, but meant for the reception of guests; these are all of small
dimensions, and were mostly built by Lady Hester.&nbsp; We were told that
she kept an establishment of a hundred servants, forty of whom were
women.&nbsp; For the last five years she never travelled beyond the garden,
and during that time the renowned two mares, Leilah and Lulu, (the former
of which was the one with the hollow back, reserved for entering Jerusalem
together with the new Messiah,) became so broken in health for want of
exercise, that when Lady Hester died, they were sold with difficulty for
300 piastres (less than three pounds) each.</p>
<p><!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>The stables still remaining were very extensive.</p>
<p>The gardens and terraces must have been beautiful, for we were told they
were carefully kept and arranged.&nbsp; We saw large myrtle shrubs in
abundance, besides fruit trees now utterly neglected&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And still where many a garden flower grows wild,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for there were red roses blooming without the least care or notice.</p>
<p>No one now resides on any part of that hill.</p>
<p>The eccentric lady is buried in the garden, and in the same grave (we
were assured) with Captain, son of General Loustaneau, a crazy French
enthusiast who lived for above twenty-five years a pensioner on her
bounty.&nbsp; The grave is covered with this simple stone monument, of a
pattern very common in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p350.jpg">
<img alt="Tomb of Lady Hester Stanhope" src="images/p350.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At the distance of a few yards is the monument over a former Moslem
proprietor of the house.</p>
<p>Lady Hester died in June 1839, lonely and <!-- page 351--><a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>miserable, and so
ended her wild dreams and fancied importance.&nbsp; During her long
residence there she had meddled in local dissensions, patronising the
Jonbl&acirc;ts of Mokht&acirc;rah against the Ameer Besheer and the
Egyptian invaders; she kept spies in the principal towns, as Acre and
Saida, and had even supplied ammunition to the citadel of Acre for the
Turks, but did not live to see the Egyptians ousted from the country.</p>
<p>There was good deal of exaggeration afloat at the time respecting her
and some of her habits of life, though scarcely more extraordinary than the
reality of other matters, as we are now able to judge of them; but at that
period Syria and the Lebanon were very little understood in Europe,
<i>i.e.</i>, from 1823 to 1839.&nbsp; She was not so utterly removed from
human society as is often supposed.&nbsp; She was not perched like an eagle
on an inaccessible mountain, for there are villages near, besides the great
Convent of Mokhallis, and she had constant communication with Saida for
money and provisions.</p>
<p>The view around is indeed stern and cheerless in character, devoid of
romantic accessories, without the rippling streams, the pines or the
poplars of either Mokht&acirc;rah or Beteddeen; her hill like its
neighbours was a lump of stone, with some scanty cultivation in the valley
below, very little of this, and her small garden attached to the
dwelling.</p>
<p><!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>Before leaving this subject, I may as well state with respect to
the common belief of Lady Hester being crowned Queen of Palmyra by the
desert Arabs, that from information which I consider reliable this is all a
mistake, or as it was expressed to me, a &ldquo;French enthusiasm,&rdquo;
the truth being that in consequence of her lavish largesses among the wild
people, they expressed their joy by acclamations in which they compared her
to the &ldquo;Queen of Sheba&rdquo; who had come among them; and then by
her flatterers, or those who were unskilled in the language, the term
&ldquo;Melekeh&rdquo; (Queen) was interpreted as above: and as for a
coronation the Arab tribes have no such a custom; the greatest chiefs, nay,
even the kings of the settled Arabs, such as Mohammed and his successors,
have never received such an inauguration.</p>
<p>Returning to the village, we found our lodging provided in the house of
a Greek Catholic family; unlike to our south country houses, it was built
with ponderous rafters of timber in the roofs, and these rafters and planks
between them are painted in coloured patterns.&nbsp; It was a cheerful
scene as the family sat inquiring about Jerusalem, or chatting otherwise on
the mustabeh (a wide stone seat) outside, with the effulgence of the
setting sun reflected on the convent before us, and then the twilight pink
and violet tints upon the mountain-range behind.</p>
<p><!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>Then again in the early morning, how delicious were the air and
the scenery of the mountains!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;Yet sluggards deem it but a foolish chase<br />
&nbsp;  And marvel men should quit their easy chair,<br />
&nbsp;  The weary mile and long, long league to trace;<br />
&nbsp;  Oh, there is sweetness in the mountain air,<br />
And life that bloated ease may never hope to share!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While mounting for the departure, our host pressing his hospitality upon
us, adjured us in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;May your religion be your
adversary if ever you pass my door without entering it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at Dair el Mokhallis we were there also received with
cordiality.&nbsp; In the church a service was going on, gabbled over by a
priest arrayed in white silk and gold, waving incense before the altar, his
congregation consisting of one person, a sort of sacristan or beadle.&nbsp;
There were some good pictures on the walls, but others together with them
of degraded rank as works of art.</p>
<p>On being invited to visit the President, we found him a jovial, handsome
man of middle age, reclining on cushions at a large window with wide views
of the sea and the mountains before him, besides <i>Dar Joon</i>, Lady
Hester&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>This establishment is not only the largest convent and church of the
Greek Catholic sect, but also a college for clerical education; their most
celebrated clergy have been trained there.&nbsp; The <!-- page 354--><a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>inmates at this time,
of all employments, were 110 in number, exclusive of servants.&nbsp; Those
whom we saw appeared very well fed, and we were not a little surprised to
find so many women servants employed within the walls.</p>
<p>A nunnery of the same rite, and rules of St Basil, with forty persons
under vows, is a good building at half-a-mile distance, between which and
the male institution a very excellent road has been made, notwithstanding
the hilly nature of the ground; other roads are being improved, and all the
contiguous grounds are in a state of the highest cultivation.</p>
<p>As we proceeded on our journey, the scenery became more and more
romantic, till on a sudden turn of the road a wondrous picture of nature
was opened before us, consisting of mountains, including our own, all
sloping down into a plain in which was a river, and a village with its
orchards and poplars; cascades rolled down the furrowed sides of these
hills, their bounding and dashing were evident to the sight, but no sound
audible owing to their distance; it was a fairy scene, or like a beautiful
dream.</p>
<p>In the descent we passed a Maronite priest riding, attended by a guide
on foot; the former was greeted by our party with his title of Abuna, a
novelty to us Jerusalemites.</p>
<p>We forded the river <i>Barook</i>, a tributary to the Awali, in front of
the above-mentioned village, <!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>which is <i>Bisrah</i>, amid tall poplars
quivering in the breeze, for their foliage had stalks long like the
aspen.</p>
<p>Our luggage having gone on during the visit to the convent, we could get
no tidings of it and our people, but a guide was procured for part of the
day&rsquo;s journey before us; and we betook ourselves to a hill over which
was, what we were assured, the only road to Hhasbeya.&nbsp; A road so steep
and thickly entangled by bushes and trees, that we inquired of every
passer-by in his turn whether we could possibly be upon the
<i>Sult&acirc;neh</i>, or high road.&nbsp; At first through an olive
plantation, then among evergreen oak, and higher still the fragrant
mountain pines.&nbsp; The zigzags of the road were necessarily so short and
abrupt, that at each turn we had to peer up perpendicularly, guessing which
way the next twist would go.&nbsp; Then still higher, towards the frowning
sombre cliffs that seemed to touch the brilliant blue sky, the arbutus
glowed with their scarlet berries, and the pine-trees became more tall,
straight, and numerous.&nbsp; No wonder that the Assyrian king, when he
boasted of being able to cut down the cedars of Lebanon, included also
&ldquo;the choice fir-trees thereof,&rdquo; (2 Kings xix. 23.)</p>
<p>Near what seemed to be the climax, we unexpectedly reached a village,
named <i>&rsquo;Azoor</i>, where a school of boys hummed their lessons in
the open air on the shady side of a house; and near them a <!-- page
356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>plank of
wood was suspended, such as serves for a church-bell in parts of the
country where the Moslems predominate, and bells are not tolerated.&nbsp;
Here in the Lebanon every village and convent may have its bells; and they
generally have them, for the Mohammedans scarcely exist throughout
&ldquo;the mountain,&rdquo; as the whole range is popularly termed from
Tarabulus to Saida.</p>
<p>The higher we ascended, the more we obtained of a brisk breeze playing
and sighing musically among the noble pines, and the ground was clothed
with heather and fragrant herbs.&nbsp; Still onwards,
&ldquo;excelsior,&rdquo; the pines were more straight and lofty; there were
patches of wild myrtle on the ground, some in white blossom; and we looked
down upon the flat roofs of villages below, an appearance so strange to us
after the round domes of the south country.</p>
<p>About noon we overtook the luggage, and the servant-boy of the muleteer
swore that his head had turned gray since we left him, four hours ago, by
reason of the bodily labour and anguish of mind that he had suffered on so
fearful a road.&nbsp; He was incessantly calling upon God by epithets out
of the Kor&acirc;n, as &ldquo;O thou Father of bounty!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;O thou knower of former things!&rdquo; mingled with curses hurled at
the mule, or prayers that her back might be strengthened: being a
Jerusalemite, he had not been accustomed to travelling of that
description.&nbsp; This youth was nicknamed by his fellows as <!-- page
357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span><i>Abu
Tabanjah</i>, &ldquo;the father of a pistol,&rdquo; from his carrying a
single pistol in his girdle: it being unusual for persons in his employment
to carry any belligerent weapons.</p>
<p>Next came the descent to <i>Jezzeen</i>, over a slippery road, with
purple crocuses in blossom at intervals.</p>
<p>Jezzeen is romantically situated among broken rocks, with a stream of
water, called the <i>Zaid</i>, bordered by a profusion of sycamore,
(<i>i.e.</i>, what is called so in England, a variety of the plane-tree,)
walnut, and aspen trees.&nbsp; We halted beneath a spreading walnut-tree,
whose leaves had already begun to change colour.</p>
<p>The inhabitants are Greek Catholic, Maronite, and a few
Mut&acirc;waleh.&nbsp; Here we had to get another guide for an hour or two
forwards&mdash;a task not easily accomplished&mdash;and he assured us that
the road before us was far worse than that we had already
traversed&mdash;he would on no account go the whole day&rsquo;s journey
with us.</p>
<p>Forwards.&mdash;Thin white clouds were resting upon the peaks high above
us, the vine terraces and poplars were succeeded by whitish-gray rocks and
olive-trees, till we issued upon a comparative level of confused chaos of
rugged rocks pitched and hurled about in the most fantastic combinations,
rendering the road almost impassable for our cattle.&nbsp; Darker clouds
than before were around, but not immediately over us; and the atmosphere
was hot like the breath of a furnace, with now and then a <!-- page
358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>momentary
gush of piercing cold coming between sharp peaks and round summits.</p>
<p>In little more than two hours from Jezzeen we were at <i>Cuf&rsquo;r
Hooneh</i>, a pretty village surrounded by sycamore, walnut, poplar, and
vineyards, with numerous running streams of water, bordered by oleanders in
rosy blossom, very tall&mdash;girt in with romantic precipices, and rooks
were cawing overhead.&nbsp; A spring of water issuing from the ground, of
which we drank, was cold like ice.</p>
<p>After this the road improved, the rocks were more friable, and were
often streaked with pink and yellow colour; indicating, I suppose, the
existence of copper mineral, (see Deut. viii. 9,) &ldquo;out of whose hills
thou mayest dig brass,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, copper.</p>
<p>All about this region fossil shells were numerous.</p>
<p>In half an hour we attained our greatest elevation, with a long line of
Mediterranean visible in the west.&nbsp; The Anti-Lebanon stretched before
us on the east, and among the hills to the south our guide declared he
could distinguish Safed.&nbsp; Here he left us, returning homewards.</p>
<p>Upon this eminence the air was reviving, and as the fervour of the sun
abated, our horses recovered energy.&nbsp; Thence we descended to a green
level space as void of inhabitants as the wild scenes that we had
traversed; and from that to a stage lower, over a very long fertile plain
running southwards, where we fell in with two or three of our <!-- page
359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>fellow human
beings, and over this the wind blew very cold.&nbsp; Forwards into another
level, a glen of wild verdure, then through chalk fissures and red slopes,
till in a moment there burst upon our view a prospect beyond all power of
description in words; Mount Hermon, (Jebel esh Shaikh,) and the intervening
long plain, also the Lit&acirc;ni river on our right, winding between
tremendous cliffs, and passing the castle of Shukeef towards the sea.</p>
<p>That river passing the foot of our mountain, and over which we had
afterwards to cross, appeared like a narrow ribbon of pale green, so silent
was it to us, for no sound from that depth could reach up so high; to this
we had to descend by a precipitous path of zigzags roughly made in the face
of the hill.</p>
<p>Half way down I first distinguished the rushing sound of the water; a
flock of goats upon its margin resembled mere black spots, but the bells
among them became faintly audible.</p>
<p>On reaching the river Lit&acirc;ni, (the classic Leontes, and named the
&ldquo;Kasimiyeh&rdquo; when debouching to the sea near Tyre,) we found it
to be a strong stream, and the dark border, which from a distance had
seemed to be low bushes, were in truth gigantic and numerous trees; on our
way to the bridge, along the river side for some distance, were parapets
erected for the safety of travellers and flocks of cattle.</p>
<p>It was after sunset, but we rested awhile to <!-- page 360--><a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>stretch our limbs
after the cramp brought on by the steep and long descent.</p>
<p>The moon was shining as we crossed the bridge, and its light was broken
in the heady dashing of the stream; the land swelled gradually upwards as
we proceeded S.-E. till we passed a ridge and turned N.-E. to the village
of <i>Cocaba</i> on the great plain, which has the river
<i>Hhasb&acirc;ni</i> flowing through it, from which village we got
directions how to find Hhasbeya.&nbsp; Thoroughly tired as we all were, the
rest of the way was most wearisome, though not so much so as it would have
been in the heat of day, after so many hours on horseback.&nbsp; The night
was bright and clear.</p>
<p>Reached <i>Hhasbeya</i> in thirteen hours from Joon in the morning.</p>
<p>The town is perched up in the line of the Anti-Lebanon, at the end of a
<i>cul-de-sac</i> running inwards from the plain, and stands at an
elevation of more than 2000 feet above the sea-level, though this is
scarcely apparent by reason of the lofty mountains everywhere around,
especially Hermon, under the shadow of which Hhasbeya is nestled.&nbsp;
This was the cleanest town and the one in best repair at that time that I
had hitherto seen in Palestine or Syria; what it may be since the
calamities of 1860, I know not.&nbsp; The majority of the inhabitants were
Christian, with a good many Druses, and a few Moslems and Jews.</p>
<p>We had a most friendly reception from the native <!-- page 361--><a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>Protestants, and from
the governor, Ameer Saad ed Deen Sheh&acirc;b and his family.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the next day we passed on to <i>Banias</i>.&nbsp;
How different a matter is travelling in that country from merely drawing a
pencil line across the map from one point to another, and measuring the
distance of that line.&nbsp; By such a method of making a journey it is but
a trifle of thirty miles from Soor to Hhasbeya, and less than a hundred and
twenty from the latter to Jerusalem.&nbsp; (I mention these places because
they belong to the journey here described,) and it may be said by
stay-at-home travellers in a carpeted saloon, at a mahogany table, that
these distances can be covered on horseback in a determinate number of
hours, allowing so many miles to an hour; but Palestine is not so smooth as
the greater part of England, and the ways (one cannot well call them roads)
are not drawn in direct lines; climate also counts for something; and
unforeseen incidents will occur to mar the plans of even those habituated
to the country.</p>
<p>To-day&rsquo;s progress, however, was tolerably plain, though not level,
and it occupied six or seven hours.</p>
<p>In an hour and a half we caught first sight of the lake <i>Hhooleh</i>
(the Semechonitis of Josephus) in the due south, and at this point we
entered upon a district strewn with volcanic basalt, in dark-brown pieces,
porous and rounded at the edges.&nbsp; A <!-- page 362--><a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>peasant directed us
forwards to the <i>Tell el K&acirc;di</i>, which at length we
reached&mdash;an eminence rising from the plain, out of which issues a
river all formed at once, gushing from the hill over a stony bed.&nbsp;
This is one of the heads of the Jordan, and the place is that of
<i>Dan</i>, which Josephus erroneously supposed to supply the last syllable
of that river&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>But beyond all question it is the site of the city Dan known throughout
Scripture history for many ages, and under a variety of circumstances:
among the rest for the forcible invasion of it by a number of colonists
from the tribe of Dan in the south of Palestine, where they found their
allotted district too strait for their possession; and being established
here, they gave the city the name of their patriarchal chief.</p>
<p>That history of their migration reads with peculiar interest and force
on the spot, and strange to say that Tell el K&acirc;di seems to retain
their tribal name, inasmuch as <i>Tell</i> signifies &ldquo;a hill,&rdquo;
and K&acirc;di is but the Arabic for the Hebrew word <i>Dan</i>, &ldquo;a
judge,&rdquo; (Gen. xlix. 16.)&nbsp; It is not however common, very much
the contrary, for names to be transmitted in this way according to their
signification through the lapse of ages&mdash;they are usually perpetuated
through their orthography.</p>
<p>The Amorite or Sidonian people living here &ldquo;at ease&rdquo; were
worshippers of Baal and Ashtaroth, or Astarte.&nbsp; Suddenly they were
assailed by the <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>Danites, who &ldquo;smote them with the edge
of the sword, and burned their city with fire;&rdquo; and the newcomers set
up &ldquo;the graven image, and the molten image, and the teraphim,&rdquo;
which they had stolen on their way thither over Mount Ephraim, appointing
the young Levite, the owner of the images, to be priest of their
idolatry.&nbsp; In later times it was a station of the golden calf of
Jeroboam&rsquo;s institution, that is to say, the revived emblem of Baal,
going back to the practice of the Leshemites; and there is yet an idea
prevailing in our days that the Druses of the neighbourhood retain that
emblem or idol among them&mdash;a remarkable instance of the perpetuity of
idolatry, and one form of idolatry under different names, modified only by
circumstances in the same locality.&nbsp; I forbear to pursue further the
reflections that can be evolved at large from that idea, as they might
bring us into other countries than Syria or Palestine.</p>
<p>Riding our horses up the full stream for a short distance, we forded it,
and entered into the shade upon the hill, where we reposed under a large
evergreen oak, decorated with rags as votive offerings to an Arab shaikh
buried beside it.&nbsp; Near this tree is an extraordinary jungle of
brambles and gigantic flowering shrubs, through which it seemed impossible
to penetrate, but out of which tangled mass the copious stream issues, as
also a minor current, which after some deflection meets the other, and
forms one stream on leaving the hill, <!-- page 364--><a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>and this, when joined
by the waters of Banias, to which we were now going, combines into one
river, Jordan, then enters and passes through the Lake Hhooleh.&nbsp; For
the present I omit the consideration of the Hhasb&acirc;ni and its spring,
which not only helps to form the Jordan, but actually commences further
beyond the springs of Dan and Banias.</p>
<p>It wanted about an hour to sunset when we turned in eastwards, round the
foot of old Hermon, for <i>Banias</i>, the C&aelig;sarea Philippi of the
New Testament, whose hill and ancient castle appeared not far distant.</p>
<p>We observed numerous small runlets of water flowing from the north and
east towards the Tell el K&acirc;di, one especially of nearly four feet
wide.&nbsp; Yet with all these blessings the district is mostly neglected,
and abandoned to a sparse population of wretched Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs and
their buffaloes.</p>
<p>We passed through neb&rsquo;k trees and stunted oaks, some karoobah
trees and sumach about twenty feet high, with their red berries, besides
myrtles almost as lofty.&nbsp; Signs of the existence of inhabitants
appeared in patches of cultivation and an occasional flock of goats.&nbsp;
Trees became closer together than at first, and at length Banias stood in
face of us, touching the foot of Hermon, which formed a magnificent
background of receding heights, but its summit withdrawn from view at that
position.&nbsp; An ancient castle crowns a high peak rising above the
village, and which for <!-- page 365--><a name="page365"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 365</span>grandeur of situation and noble aspect is
unsurpassed by any ruin that I have seen in Syria.&nbsp; Yet how small was
all this in comparison with the mighty mass at its back!&nbsp; I regret the
having been unable to examine this remarkable fortress, the modern name of
which is the <i>Kula&rsquo;at es Subeibeh</i>.</p>
<p>The halt was in an olive plantation, and while the tents were being
raised, I rode forwards to the other celebrated source of the Jordan,
namely, that issuing from the cavern, and drank of its water, but first had
to swim the horse through a strong current.</p>
<p>How beautiful was the evening scene of rocks, trees, blue mountains, and
the extended plain, with the thread of the Hhasb&acirc;ni winding through
it on the western side!&nbsp; There were also herds of cattle coming in,
and a shepherd boy playing his rural pipes.&nbsp; What a scene for
Poussin!&nbsp; I offered to buy the Pandean pipe (of several reeds joined
laterally) from the boy, wishing to have it for my own, obtained at the
mythological home of Pan himself&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pan primus calamos cer&acirc; conjungere plures<br />
Instituit,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the lad asked an exorbitant price for it, and strode away.</p>
<p>Then rushed up to make use of the fading twilight for catching at least
a glimpse of the Greek inscriptions and Pan&rsquo;s grotto, from which the
<!-- page 366--><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>river issues, not in infantile weakness, but boldly striking an
echo against the sides of the natural cavity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Pan is dead!&rdquo; as the superstitious peasants of
Thessaly said, when they imagined they heard the echo formed into words,
sixteen hundred years ago; and while musing on the &ldquo;rise and
fall&rdquo; of the classic idolatry, a bat flew past me out of the grotto,
but I saw no moles for the old idols to be thrown to, (Isa. ii. 20.)</p>
<p>Pan was the mythological deity presiding over caverns, woods, and
streams, from whom this place received its denomination of Panion or Paneas
in Greek, or Panium in Latin; and the word Paneas becomes Banias in Arabic,
as it is at this day.&nbsp; Here costly temples and altars were raised, and
Herod built a temple in honour of Augustus C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; These
edifices have fallen to the ground, the idols have been demolished by early
Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans; but niches with pedestals, on which the
dumb figures stood, accompanied by inscriptions, still remain in
attestation of written history.</p>
<p>Of these inscriptions I took copies next morning, as others have also
done, but with special pains to insure accuracy.&nbsp; Every one of them
has the name of the god Pan; two of them have the name of Agrippa; one is
set up by a priest of Pan, &ldquo;for the welfare of the lords the
emperors;&rdquo; and another is dedicated by Agrippa, son of <!-- page
367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>Marcus, who
had been for eight years Archon, and had been admonished in a dream by the
god Pan.&nbsp; The breaks in the words caused by defaced letters make it
difficult to get more signification out of them.</p>
<p>Some further remarks on the same, as well as copies of the tablets, will
be found in appendix B.</p>
<p>In a field near our tents, were two prostrate granite columns of about
fifteen feet length of shaft by two in diameter; besides a piece of column
of common stone three feet in diameter.&nbsp; In another part of the same
field was a square capital of pilaster with some plain moulding, and an
abundance of squared stones of two to three feet dimensions; such, however,
are to be seen scattered in every direction around.</p>
<p>A small ancient bridge crosses one of the several streams branching away
from the main course, and all running between steep banks.&nbsp; By this
bridge I approached a noble gateway, leading into a very large square
fortress, with strong ancient towers at each corner.&nbsp; The arches of
both gate and bridge were Roman; parts of the walls remained in their
regular courses, and numerous large rabbeted stones were rolled down in
disorder upon the slope and into a military trench.&nbsp; But the whole
scene, whether of rugged rocks or of the work of man, was fringed and
clothed with brambles, ferns, evergreens, and the rosy oleander.</p>
<p><!-- page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>The principal charm, however, belongs to the grotto with the
river which it discharges&mdash;the site of which may be described as a
semicircular termination of a valley on a natural platform half way up a
cliff&mdash;the water tumbles down in short cascades for some distance; the
grotto inside is untouched by chisel squarings or embellishment, just as
Juvenal wished the grot of &AElig;geria to be.</p>
<p>All this is particularly romantic, but a more exalted interest is
attached to the town and vicinity of Banias from its being a certainly
known station of our Redeemer&rsquo;s journeys&mdash;He who in all His
travels &ldquo;went about doing good&rdquo;&mdash;but, inasmuch as some
records of His blessed footsteps are connected with incidents of higher
importance than others, this one rises into transcendant value, as being
the place where His eternal divinity was distinctly enunciated.</p>
<p>At that very time the temple of Augustus, erected by Herod, was in its
freshest beauty; the votive inscriptions with the name of Agrippa were
newly chiselled; and the priests of Pan were celebrating sacrifices and
incense, together with rustic offerings, upon his altar; the worship, too,
of Baal was still in existence, under some modifications, upon the mountain
overhead.&nbsp; At such a place, and under such circumstances, was the
Church universal promised to be founded on the rock of faith to which Peter
had given utterance.</p>
<p>It may be here observed that at that period this <!-- page 369--><a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>C&aelig;sarea
Philippi was not a secluded spot, as commentators generally make it,
because Banias is so now; but the town was one of notoriety, adorned, as we
have just seen, with expensive public edifices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On returning to the tents, the shaikh of the village came, attended by
some of his relatives belonging to Hhasbeya, begging for some quinine
medicine: I gave him eight of my twelve remaining pills.&nbsp; On the
adjacent plain there must needs be fever and ague; in fact, so unwilling
was I on account of malaria to remain longer at Banias, that we resumed our
travelling by night.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we were
mounted&mdash;there was a little rain at the time, and clouds that
threatened more of it obscured the setting moon; there was lightning also
in the same direction.&nbsp; I even altered my plan of going on to
&ldquo;the bridge of the daughters of Jacob,&rdquo; (the thoroughfare
between Safed and Damascus,) in order to escape from the plain as quickly
as possible.&nbsp; For this purpose we turned westwards, and had to
struggle through marshes and rough ground by starlight and lightning.&nbsp;
Most unwisely we had neglected to take a meal before starting, not
expecting the district to be so plashy and unwholesome as it proved to
be.&nbsp; The plain, north of the Lake Hhooleh, is traversed by innumerable
channels of water, among which rice is grown, of which I gathered a handful
as a <!-- page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>trophy to exhibit in Jerusalem.&nbsp; And there were lines of
tents of the poor Ghaw&acirc;rineh Arabs upon dry ground, besides small
scaffolds standing in the rice marshes, from which elevations the people
watch the crops and fire upon wild beasts that come to injure or devour the
crops; dogs barked as we passed, and fires were visible in several
directions.</p>
<p>Arriving at the bridge of <i>El Ghujar</i>, my companion and I both felt
sick, and had to dismount and rest for a time.</p>
<p>Our guide&rsquo;s account of the river differed from that given in
Robinson; instead of the stream being the Hhasb&acirc;ni and the bridge
named El Ghujar, he averred that the river is El Ghujar, and that it rises
out of the ground like the waters of Banias and of Tell el
K&acirc;di.&nbsp; Perhaps this may account for Porter more recently placing
the bridge El Ghujar in a different situation, much farther north.&nbsp;
The circumstance is not without value in inquiries as to the collective
formation of the Jordan.</p>
<p>As daylight broke we could see herds of buffaloes among the marshes, or
swimming in the water with only their heads raised above the surface; the
village of <i>Khalsah</i> was half way up the hill-side.</p>
<p>From this point the road was level, dry, and comfortable, running due
southwards along the western margin of the plain, but with streams
occasionally crossing it, rushing from the hills towards the lake.</p>
<p><!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>Near <i>&rsquo;Ain el Mell&acirc;hhah</i> two Arabs rode up to us
and planted their spears in the ground near our horses heads as a warning
to stop, and I suppose to pay ghuf&rsquo;r.&nbsp; I kept on, leaving the
kaww&acirc;s to parley with them.</p>
<p>Not far from the fountain we rested under a terebinth tree (not a
favourable specimen) upon a rising ground; beneath us, but at a short
distance, the strong stream turns a mill, passing through a house, and
escapes to the plain.</p>
<p>The Arabs met us again, and said they were looking for a horse that was
lost, and we saw no more of them.</p>
<p>In another hour my companion was taken with a strong fit of ague, which
urged us the more to press onward for Safed.&nbsp; From the hills, as we
rose higher and higher, the Lake Hhooleh was perceived to be, above
one-third of it, choked up with weeds and rushes.&nbsp; Old Hermon showed
himself in surpassing grandeur; not a confused mass&mdash;as he does from
the plain looking upwards from close beneath him&mdash;but as one grand
&ldquo;monarch of mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On a throne of rocks, with a robe of clouds,<br />
&nbsp;  And a diadem of snow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sun was hot and the hills chalky over which we passed.&nbsp; In one
place by our wayside, and at considerable elevation, I found squared
masonry stones and traces of houses, with fragments of columns.</p>
<p><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>A poor Arab peasant, driving an ass laden with a wooden box, was
groaning with pain, and implored us for a draught of water, but I fear that
our people had neglected to bring any with them, as they expected to be so
soon in Safed.</p>
<p>Rested under the shade of some large stones, and sent on a message
before us to the town.&nbsp; In quarter of an hour, however, some peals of
thunder roused us to pursue the journey; the strong wind that arose at the
same time was not good for ague patients.&nbsp; Across the great plain as
we looked back was a broad faint piece of rainbow, and the huge mountain,
mantled with clouds about his shoulders, but bright below, appeared
peculiarly fantastic, with flickering shadows of clouds chasing over his
sunny sides.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Safed we found, as customary at that season,
(Bairam,) the newly white-washed graves of the Moslems, adorned with
bunches of myrtle.</p>
<p>At Safed we lodged in the house of a Russo-British Jew, and letters from
Jerusalem that had awaited us came safe to hand, after which followed the
necessary reception of visitors, very troublesome to weary and exhausted
travellers, and at last a supper which had been long in preparing&mdash;at
least so it seemed to be.</p>
<p><!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
373</span>PART II.</p>
<p>This, like the journey last described, of six years before, was portion
of a much longer tour, but I omit all that cannot come under the
designation of a Byeway in Palestine.&nbsp; The two routes were very
similar to each other, with the exception of the passage from Banias to
Safed.</p>
<p>Starting from Saida, and trending south-eastwards towards Hhasbeya, we
climbed the mountains, which here rise almost from the sea-shore, and
crossed romantic passes of rugged eminences and deeply cleft ravines.</p>
<p>From Hhasbeya the line was due south to Banias, thence westward by Tell
el K&acirc;di, and Hhuneen, and Tibneen, the capital of the Bel&acirc;d
Besh&acirc;rah, thus almost reaching once more the plain of Ph&oelig;nicia
on its eastern verge; next by the antiquities of Kadesh Naphtali southwards
to Safed; and homewards to Jerusalem, but this latter route is not to be
described, for the reason given above.</p>
<p>I was accompanied by my niece and another lady, a settled resident of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; The first object after quitting Saida was to visit Joon,
and to show my companions the residence of Lady Hester Stanhope in years
gone by.&nbsp; This we reached just before sunset, on the 2d of October
1855.</p>
<p><!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>The tomb was found much dilapidated; in 1853 it was no longer in
so good a condition as it had been in 1849, but it was now even worse, and
the whole spectacle of house, stables, and gardens, was melancholy in the
extreme: the deprivation of roofs gives a peculiar aspect of desolation to
any abandoned dwelling, especially when the gardens have still their
cultivable flowers remaining, but running riot within their marked-out
beds; these had now been sixteen years neglected, yet the roses and myrtle
only required pruning.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the convent, the road was stony, and we had to find the
way by twilight and starlight.</p>
<p>At the great door we were received by the new president, and several of
the clergy chanting psalms for welcome, and the great bell was ringing at
the same time.&nbsp; I could not but attribute all this unusual display to
the operation of political affairs in Europe.</p>
<p>On taking possession of the rooms allotted to us, I received a visit of
the Greek Catholic Bishop of Saida, he being there on business connected
with the election of a new patriarch in the place of Maximus; his
deportment was that of a man of polite society.&nbsp; Our rooms were
lighted by huge ecclesiastical tapers of wax.</p>
<p>Next morning, after returning the visit of the bishop at the patriarchal
residence in front of the convent, we breakfasted in the corridor with the
<!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>president and another of the convent clergy.&nbsp; Our ladies
then set themselves to sketching the view from the window, and talking
about church singing from notes, whereupon the president sent a deacon to
fetch his book, and the latter sang for us an anthem, the vociferation and
screechings of which was so alarming, not to mention the nasal twang, that
my niece had to run away to indulge in an obstreperous laugh, and her
senior companion had also much difficulty in refraining from the same kind
of expression of opinion.&nbsp; The Oriental system of church musical
notation is very complicated, having no stave-lines or bars, but only
certain arbitrary marks over the notes to designate high or low, plain or
flourishing.</p>
<p>Afterwards we inspected the church; then the refectory, and there they
showed us the desk at which one of the community reads to the rest at meal
time, triumphantly assuring me that they read the Bible, yet the two books
I found on the desk were, one the Apocryphal writings, the other some
homilies of St Basil, under whose rule the convent is constituted.</p>
<p>Next we walked over the roof, and looked at the great bell, and the
gong; the view, as might be expected, repaid the trouble.&nbsp; After this
the kitchen and the store-rooms.</p>
<p>On leaving the convent we proceeded to the nunnery in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The ladies visited the inmates, while I remained in an
outer <!-- page 376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>apartment chatting with a priest, till a curtain was drawn aside,
and there, behold! were the lady-president and her flock, curious to see a
consul, and blaming the servants for not having admitted me together with
my companions.</p>
<p>The latter gave me afterwards as their opinion of the establishment,
that it very much resembled a comfortable asylum or almshouse for old
women.</p>
<p>By this deviation from the high roads we lost the fairy view in that
neighbourhood which had charmed me so much in 1849.</p>
<p>There is a pleasing novelty to us non-Lebanonites in being in a native
Christian country.&nbsp; Every hill there has its convent, every convent
its bells; clergy are continually passing along the road; and on our
descent of the hill we met a nice old gentleman in clerical dress, with a
very white beard, holding a crimson umbrella over his head, (this is not
uncommon in Palestine,) and preceded by a kaww&acirc;s with a silver-headed
official staff, also accompanied by a few peasants carrying
guns,&mdash;this was a Maronite bishop.</p>
<p>Crossed the river Barook at <i>Bisrah</i>, and ascended the usual
highway leading to Hhasbeya.</p>
<p>At the village of <i>Ineer</i> we took further directions, and followed
over a very wild scene to nearly the summit of a mountain called
<i>Rummet-er-Room</i>, (the Ramah, or high-place, of the Greeks,) from
which the glorious landscape surpasses all power of description&mdash;it is
one not to be forgotten.</p>
<p><!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>At <i>&rsquo;Azoor</i>, a clean pleasant village, the women and
girls ran in crowds to gaze at my ladies; one of the women shouted
&ldquo;Bon soir&rdquo; in good French, and a man, accompanied by his wife,
saluted us in Italian.</p>
<p>Rested in a beautiful wood of pines, though rather late for luncheon, as
the sun was falling below the western mountains.&nbsp; Rising higher on the
march we got into rolling misty clouds, and the brilliant effect of
sunbeams between the hills and clouds could not but be surprising.&nbsp;
Our clothes, however, got damp and chill.</p>
<p>At <i>Jezzeen</i> our tents were found ready pitched in a grove of noble
walnut-trees, with the brook <i>Zaid</i> running among them; near alongside
was a Maronite convent, with a bridge.</p>
<p>The muleteers having left us in the morning, lost their way, and had
taken the more precipitous road by <i>Dair Mushmushi</i>.</p>
<p>Here the people behaved with great hospitality to us.</p>
<p>The night was very cold, and in the morning the water for washing felt
like ice.&nbsp; The position of our encampment, as perceived by daylight,
was so low between hills that the sun could not reach us till the day
should be considerably advanced, yet we were at a very high altitude.&nbsp;
Pity that we had no aneroid barometer with us to ascertain the amount of
our elevation above the sea.&nbsp; The poplar-trees and walnut-trees, with
fruit trees of <!-- page 378--><a name="page378"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 378</span>various kinds, showed we were in a totally
different region from that of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Jezzeen is almost exclusively a Christian village, with a Greek Catholic
church, besides two Maronite churches, and the small convent mentioned
above.</p>
<p>There were clergy walking about; the people cleanly and well clothed,
the children modestly behaved, and even when rendering a service, not
asking for bakhsheesh.</p>
<p>At the time of our leaving, a party of women were wailing over a dead
body under a tree.</p>
<p>The scene gradually became more romantic; and we soon came to a village,
if such it may be denominated, where the only dwellings are dispersed among
vineyards.&nbsp; These vineyards were, at that autumn season, becoming of a
brown and golden tint.</p>
<p>After traversing the wondrous chaos referred to in the former journey,
we passed through the villages of <i>Cuf&rsquo;r Hooneh</i> and
<i>Deheedeh</i>, adjoining each other; where there was abundance of water,
and oleander bushes fringing the streamlets, with poplar and maple
trees.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey had no remarkable difference from that of 1849,
except that on the brow of the great descent to the plain, between Lebanon
and the Anti-Lebanon, we rested beneath an olive-tree entwined with
honeysuckle, enraptured with the magnificence of the scene, which would
<!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>require a Milton to portray it in words, or a Martin in
painting.&nbsp; I observed that the prevailing tints of the whole great
prospect were of russet and ochreous colours.</p>
<p>Crossed the bridge, charmed with the beauteous verdure and freshening
rapid stream of the Leontes river; and when arrived at Hhasbeya, repaired
to the house of the native Protestant pastor, (Mr John Wartabed,) till a
house could be prepared for us.</p>
<p>Next morning some deputations of the religious sects of the town called
upon me; also the Ameer Saad ed Deen and his five sons in rich dresses; and
lastly, an old Druse who had distinguished himself as a friend of the
Protestant movement.&nbsp; Among all these, my visit there had a beneficial
effect upon the existence and progress of native Protestantism.&nbsp; In
the Lebanon the Druses have always favoured the missionaries, their schools
and their chapels, while the native Christian communities, under the
direction of their clergy, have naturally opposed them by every possible
means of the direst persecution.&nbsp; In proper time and place I may
hereafter have more to say respecting this visit to Hhasbeya.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mr Wartabed and the Khoja Bashi, (representative
member in the town-council,) of the Protestants, named Naseef er Reis, rode
with us to the source of the Hhasbani river, which ought to be regarded as
the origin of the Jordan, even though Banias lower down has been for ages
<!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>recognised as such.&nbsp; We saw the bubbles at their earliest
birth issue from the ground, and in a few yards this becomes a flowing
stream.&nbsp; Higher above this spot the bed of a torrent brings down water
in rainy seasons, adding to the springs of the Hhasb&acirc;ni, but this not
being permanent, cannot fairly be counted as having part or lot in the
Jordan.</p>
<p>The ladies sat down to take sketches, and in haste I pencilled down in
short-hand&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Jordan, dear Jordan, the feelings that throng<br />
And press on the heart must awaken to song,<br />
When the bubbles from pebbles break forth into view<br />
As clear as the spangles of morn&rsquo;s early dew.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Mid the poplars that rising surpass other trees,<br />
And twinkle as moved by the scarce mountain breeze,<br />
And the wild oleander in rose-colour&rsquo;d bloom,<br />
With trill of the linnet, and shrubs of perfume.</p>
<p>I have drunk from each source that advances a claim<br />
To share with our Jordan its time-honour&rsquo;d name;<br />
Here now at Hhasbeya&mdash;and the old site of Dan;<br />
Or the gush that escapes from the grotto of Pan.</p>
<p>How oft on far banks of its tortuous course,<br />
In the scenes of repose or of cataract force,<br />
Where the bulbul, &rsquo;mid willows and tamarisk shades,<br />
Still warbles&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ladies, the horses are ready, and we have further to
go,&rdquo; broke in upon the muse of Lebanon.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s work
had to be finished, and time was short; so we rode away to the bitumen <!--
page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>pits in
the neighbourhood of Cocaba.&nbsp; These are not worked in warm weather,
for the people are afraid of the possible effects of their gas generated
under a hot sun.&nbsp; One of the pits is seventy ells, or cubits, deep,
and the bitumen is reached through a crust of chalky soil.&nbsp; The
property is a government monopoly, rented by natives, and the business is
lazily and irregularly carried on; therefore, sometimes the success is
greater than at others.&nbsp; We found two men living in a tent as
guardians of the place, who were very civil to us, and permitted us to
carry away some specimens.&nbsp; These were all of a very soft consistency;
but at the bitumen works at four hours north of Hhasbeya, the mineral is of
a still softer description, almost liquid.</p>
<p>Next morning, the K&acirc;di paid us a visit, accompanied by a merchant
of Damascus, a correspondent of an English house in India for indigo.</p>
<p>On Sunday we attended divine service at the native Protestant church,
which the people call the English church, and in virtue thereof have set up
a bell above it; because, although the mission is carried on by American
money and under the direction of American agents, the American consuls are
forbidden by their home-government from taking any steps in behalf of their
undertakings; and thus, but for the protection given them by Mr Wood,
British consul of Damascus, and his consular friends at Bayroot, the
American Mission, with <!-- page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>all their schools and printing-presses, would,
upon all human calculation, have been crushed long ago.</p>
<p>In conformity with Oriental usage, the congregation was divided
according to the sexes.&nbsp; In the old Eastern churches the women are
placed in a gallery above the men, but here the equality of the sexes was
maintained by their occupying the same floor, while separated from each
other by a wall built rather higher than the usual stature of a man; the
pulpit being equally visible from each division.&nbsp; A large jar of water
stood in the corner within the door, to which the men repaired
occasionally, as they felt thirsty.&nbsp; There were no chairs or benches,
except such as were brought from the house for our party, the congregation
were sitting on their heels, in which posture they sang the hymns, and
remained so during the prayer, only covering the face with the right hand;
a few men, however, stood up.</p>
<p>The singing (Arabic) was good, of course all in unison.&nbsp; The first
hymn was to the tune of our &ldquo;Old Hundredth,&rdquo; the chapters read
by the minister were Ezek. xviii. and Rom. iii., and the text of the sermon
was Ps. lxxxix. 14, &ldquo;Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy
throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.&rdquo;&nbsp; The style of
language in the sermon was that of good Arabic, but of simple, unpretending
character, without admixture of foreign words or phrases: this was insured
by the circumstance of the minister being a <!-- page 383--><a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>native of the
country, though originally belonging to the Armenian Church.</p>
<p>At the afternoon service the chapters read were Num. xxiii. and Heb.
xiii.&nbsp; The text for the sermon was Heb. xiii. 8, &ldquo;Jesus Christ,
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,&rdquo; and the hymn was sung to a
sweet plaintive air of American origin.</p>
<p>Afterwards, that is after sunset, we spent some hours with the
pastor&rsquo;s family, who all understood English well.&nbsp; Mr Wartabed
played the flute to the hymn-singing, and his sister&rsquo;s voice was
clear as a flageolet.&nbsp; The evening was one of comfort and refreshment
on both sides; it was one of a Sabbath, &ldquo;a delight, the holy of the
Lord, honourable,&rdquo; (Isa. lviii. 13.)</p>
<p>The poor Protestants have not always been in such satisfactory
circumstances.&nbsp; Their principal man had narratives to relate of chains
and imprisonment endured in past times from the present Ameer, whose policy
was now in their favour.</p>
<p>Next morning we left Hhasbeya, and I have not been there since.&nbsp;
Little could it be foreseen that in five years afterwards one
indiscriminate butchery would be made of the Ameer and his son,
notwithstanding their high descent of family and profession of Islam,
together with all the Christians of whatever sect in the town, driven like
sheep within the walls of his palace&mdash;a deed of treachery unexampled
even in that period of bloody Turkish <!-- page 384--><a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>treachery.&nbsp;
Since then my lady companions are both in their graves, the one at
Jerusalem, the other at Bayroot, let me rather say in &ldquo;a better
country,&rdquo; while I am left alone to narrate this in the distant
security of England.</p>
<p>On our way towards Banias we met a party of Druses returning from a
small lake beyond Hhooleh, carrying leeches in earthen jars and cotton bags
upon asses, they themselves walking.&nbsp; A green hill on our right was
said to be frequented by wild boars&mdash;all the rest of our scenery was
bare and stony.</p>
<p>A weli was a conspicuous object at some distance to the south, and near
to the Lake Hhooleh, which the Moslems name after &ldquo;Judah the son of
Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the Hhasbeya Protestants, who was with us,
quoted in his native Arabic &ldquo;The sceptre shall not depart from
Judah,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>At Tell el K&acirc;di we reposed beneath the great tree near the gush of
its branch of the Jordan, the same tree (evergreen oak) as afforded us
shelter in 1849.&nbsp; Both this spring of the river and that of Banias are
far more striking objects than the humble source of the Hhasb&acirc;ni,
into which stream they run as affluents, making up the Jordan.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful evening of mellow sunlight, and the scene most
peaceful at the foot of Hermon.</p>
<p>On nearing Banias we were met by the son of the shaikh of the village,
sent out to invite us.&nbsp; It was harvest time of the Simsim,
(Sesam&eacute;,) and the produce was very abundant; sheaves of it were <!--
page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>piled
up into large stacks, and the length of the plant in stalk exceeded all I
had ever seen before,&mdash;a natural effect of growing on these
well-watered plains.</p>
<p>There were also my old friends the myrtles scattered about among the
other trees.</p>
<p>At Banias our attendants had pitched the tents, to our disgust, near the
village, and with the stench of carrion not far off; much better places
might have been taken, but this was selected probably in consequence of the
invitation from the shaikh.&nbsp; Our short remainder of twilight was
employed in viewing the inscriptions and the grotto of Pan.</p>
<p>Next morning I was making fresh transcriptions of the Greek votive
dedications before the sun was up, so as to get them as accurately as
possible without sunshine and shadows.&nbsp; Then the same once more after
breakfast, with the sun full upon them.&nbsp; These, together with the
copies taken in 1849 by afternoon sunlight, and consequently the shadows
thrown in the reverse direction, ought to ensure for me a correct
delineation, saving and except those letters that are defaced by the action
of weather during fifteen centuries, or across which small cracks have been
made by the same cause.</p>
<p>The shaikh came to transact some business of consequence to him.&nbsp;
Before noon we resumed our journey; going due west through the
Sesam&eacute; harvest and the myrtle trees to Tell el K&acirc;di; straight
across the plain through marshes, frequent small <!-- page 386--><a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>streams, and large
fields of rice, which they said would be fit for reaping in twenty days
more, that is, by the end of October.</p>
<p>Crossed the Ghujar bridge, but did not as before turn off to Safed; our
object now was to reach Tibneen in the Bel&acirc;d Besh&acirc;rah, and
therefore we kept on due west, ascending up to the great crusading castle
and the village of <i>Huneen</i>, from which the look back upon Jebel esh
Shaikh (Hermon) was indescribably grand.</p>
<p>A little farther on, a glimpse was caught of the Mediterranean Sea! the
mountain breeze most delightful.&nbsp; Rested by the roadside for luncheon;
came to the village of <i>Hhooleh</i>, thence into lower valleys of green
woods, often with scarce room to pass ourselves, our horses, and the
luggage between branches of trees for some successive hours.&nbsp; Then
under the village of <i>Jahh&acirc;rah</i>, where were charcoal burners
working at their kilns.</p>
<p>The scene opened into verdant glades, alternated with woodland; the
breathing most pure as exhaled from trees upon firm dry ground, contrasted
with the noxious vapours from the marshes in the early morning.</p>
<p>Flocks and shepherds appeared, and there was the sound of the axe busy
in the woods; not the ringing sound of the bright large English axe, this
being wanted in the stroke of the petty Oriental tools.</p>
<p>As evening drew on, and broad shadows fell from <!-- page 387--><a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>green hills across
our way, Tibneen Castle came nobly into view, and there a goodly reception
awaited us.&nbsp; A strange medley of splendour, with fleas and dust,
obtained throughout the establishment, and our ladies visited those of the
Hhareem, concerning whom they brought back no agreeable report.</p>
<p>We remained over two nights at Tibneen; the latter of which was,
throughout its whole duration, one of furious storm, rattling the wooden
lattices that served for windows; a storm not uncommon in the East, when an
adverse wind meets and drives back a strong shirocco.&nbsp; At daybreak the
first sound of the morning was that of a large trained hawk near the
window, chained to his perch, and screaming out his delight in the bluster
of the tempest.&nbsp; Mount Hermon appeared, not in his summer glow, but in
solemn majesty, defying the clouds and the winds that raged in vain against
his solid substance.</p>
<p>Our progress was thence towards Safed, which, however, we did not reach
in less than eleven hours and a half, instead of six, because of our
circuit made to see the antiquities of Kadis and Cuf&rsquo;r
Bera&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>Turning off before Bint el Jebail, we came to <i>&rsquo;Ain Atha</i>,
and next to <i>Aitur&acirc;n</i>.&nbsp; At Kadis (Kedesh Naphtali) I found
that much of the principal and beautiful temple had been lately despoiled
by our late host of Tibneen (&rsquo;Ali Bek) for the <!-- page 388--><a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>ornamentation of his
Hhareem or women&rsquo;s apartments, and balconies or galleries.&nbsp; Then
to <i>Yaroon</i>, near which was still the ponderous sarcophagus upon a
platform in the open country, and likely to stay there for ages to
come.&nbsp; It is too plain and devoid of ornament or inscription for
antiquarians from Europe to covet it, and to remove it for no particular
use would demand too much exertion from the natives of the country.&nbsp;
My groom, however, thought it might be useful as a depository of barley in
the stable!</p>
<p>We overtook a party of Safed people returning from the weekly market at
Bint el Jebail.</p>
<p>At Cuf&rsquo;r Bera&rsquo;am we inspected the ancient buildings now
bearing Hebrew inscriptions, and I was more than ever convinced in my own
mind, that neither these nor any edifices at Kadis have any relation to the
Jewish people, in their origin or intention.&nbsp; The Hebrew writing is of
inferior style, and very modern character, far, far unequal to the beauty
of the architecture; besides having evident traces of animal figures which
have been hastily chiselled off.</p>
<p>The sun set, and a bad road had to be traversed in order to reach our
destination at Safed.</p>
<p><!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>PART III.</p>
<p>In my two journeys just described, the route was over the southern part
of the long Lebanon range, not only on the main ridge, but crossing some of
the innumerable spurs thrown out towards the sea.&nbsp; This time, however,
we have to deal with a more northerly and higher region; and it is because
of its being in a different direction from those of 1849 and 1855 that I
have not observed the consecutive order of date&mdash;this was in
1853.&nbsp; We shall start from the coast, where the most projecting and
western spur subsides into Ras Bayroot, and the climbing begins almost
immediately after leaving deep yellow sands and the pine forest.</p>
<p>The object was to reach Mokht&acirc;rah, perched high in the heart of
the Shoof or central ridge of Lebanon, like an eyrie, as it was then, for
the princely house of Jonbl&acirc;t.&nbsp; Mokht&acirc;rah lies S.-E. from
Bayroot, and to arrive there we had to cross the intervening spurs,
climbing as we went.</p>
<p>The town of Dair el Kamar and the palace of Beteddeen, formerly the
headquarters of the house of Sheh&acirc;b, lay upon the road.&nbsp; The
remainder of the journey after Mokht&acirc;rah consisted in a rapid descent
to Sidon, the great port in antiquity for Damascus, Ph&oelig;nicia, and the
Lebanon.</p>
<p>This tour comprised the finest range of the territory occupied by the
Druse nation.</p>
<p><!-- page 390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>1853.&nbsp; <i>July</i>.&mdash;From Bayroot, with its bewitching
scenery and its gorgeous colouring of mountains and the sea, we went to
<i>&rsquo;Abeih</i>, the best known of the American missionary stations in
the Lebanon.</p>
<p>Through the woods of pines, with their reviving fragrance, and through
<i>El Hadeth</i>, an entirely Christian village, where the bell of the
Maronite convent was ringing as we passed, we came to
<i>Shuwaif&acirc;t</i>, and rose still higher towards the mountain pines
and the breezes so desirable in Syria in the month of July, leaving below
the olive in abundance, the mulberry and the fig-trees.</p>
<p>Beside the fountain called <i>&rsquo;Ain Bes&acirc;ba</i> was a pottery
factory.&nbsp; The nature of the rocks around was soft sandstone; a
gigantic pear-tree stood conspicuous among the excellent cultivation of the
neighbourhood; higher still, between straight tall pines and wild
holly-oaks, our road curved round and round the hills.</p>
<p>We overtook a company of Christians, the women riding and the men
walking&mdash;this circumstance alone would show they were not
Mohammedans.&nbsp; The two parties had to pass each other with much
caution, as the path was narrow and the precipice deep below.</p>
<p>At <i>&rsquo;Ain &rsquo;Anoob</i>, where a copious supply of water
issues from three spouts, the fountain has on each side the representation
of a chained lion, sculptured in stone.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s first impression
would <!-- page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>be that this were a relic of the Genoese or Venetian crusaders;
but these figures, whatever their meaning or origin, are not infrequent
upon fountains about the Lebanon, even when only rustically daubed in red
ochre; and it has not been often noticed that there are similar lions
facing each other, only without the chains, one on each side of St
Stephen&rsquo;s Gate at Jerusalem.&nbsp; Some of the women at the fountains
wore the horns on their head, the fashion for which is gradually passing
away.&nbsp; The terraces on the hills were in the highest state of
cultivation, and gave abundant promise of fruit for the coming season; the
sun was near setting, the rooks cawing overhead, and we saw two little
girls each bring a lamb to the fountain to drink and then proceed to wash
them.</p>
<p>Sidi Ahhmad, a Druse &rsquo;Akal, with, of course, a white turban,
undertook to be our guide as far as &rsquo;Abeih.</p>
<p>Fresh air to breathe! how different from the oppressive heat of
Bayroot!&nbsp; We all drank of every spring by the way, and by consequence
lifted up the drooping head, (Ps. cx. 7,) thinking each fountain colder
than that before it.</p>
<p>The most rugged portion of the road was between <i>&rsquo;Ain
&rsquo;Anoob</i> and <i>&rsquo;Ainab</i>, and zigzag were the worn tracks
of the way.&nbsp; Sometimes a musical jingle of bells announced the coming
of travellers in front, who were however invisible till they pounced upon
us from between two pinnacles of <!-- page 392--><a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>rocks.&nbsp; On the
steepest ascents it was necessary to halt and await the coming up of our
baggage mules.</p>
<p>From mountain heights it is often difficult to distinguish the blue
expanse of the Mediterranean Sea from the similar blue expanse of the sky,
until the actual moment of sunset, when the bright orb becoming suddenly
flattened on its lower curve reveals the exact horizon line; and so it was
this evening.</p>
<p>Wearied with the climbing position of the saddle, hour after hour, I
passed <i>&rsquo;Ain Kesoor</i> on foot, the &rsquo;Akal leading the
horse.&nbsp; This was shortly before &rsquo;Abeih, but there I rode up to
the mansion of Kasim Bek, the local governor, to ask hospitality; it was
dark night, and Saturday.&nbsp; My intention was to spend the Sunday in a
Christian manner among the American missionaries.&nbsp; The journey had
been one of five hours and a half from Bayroot.</p>
<p>We were heartily received into a fine old house, in which were shaikhs
and chiefs of sundry grades seated on the divan with the host, and
immediately the means for washing were brought by the domestics with great
respect.&nbsp; A good supper was prepared, the Bek eating with us, to my
surprise, but I afterwards learned that this is not uncommon with a
non-&rsquo;Akal Druse, as he was.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Quiet morning.&nbsp; Bell of the Capuchin Convent
almost adjoining the house.&nbsp; From the <!-- page 393--><a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>windows there is a
fine prospect of Bayroot and the coast-outline.</p>
<p>After breakfast I went up to the chapel of the American missionaries,
and entered just as the Arabic service was about to commence&mdash;Dr de
Forest in the pulpit; and his sermon was preached with fluency of language
equal to that of a native.&nbsp; The subject was taken from 1 Cor. i. 12,
13, concerning those who named themselves followers of Paul or of
Apollos.&nbsp; The women were screened off from the men in the
congregation.</p>
<p>After service Dr de Forest welcomed me, and led me up the hill to the
mission-house, where I found my old friend, Dr Eli Smith, who was unwell,
and about to leave them on the morrow for his home at
B&rsquo;hamdoon.&nbsp; With Mrs de Forest there was a young lady just
arrived from the United States to be a teacher in the school.</p>
<p>The residence is a good one; with the girls&rsquo; school on the ground
plan, and the dwelling apartments above.&nbsp; The scenery and prospect
equal all that the highest imagination could conceive of the Lebanon.&nbsp;
Over the sea, the island of Cyprus can occasionally be distinguished from
the terrace, that is to say, three peaks of a mountain show themselves at
sunset, particularly if the wind be in the north, in the month of May or
the beginning of June.&nbsp; This view, therefore, gives the outskirts of
&ldquo;the isles of Chittim,&rdquo; as seen from the Holy Land, (Num. xxiv.
24, and Jer. ii. 10.)</p>
<p><!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>After dinner we all went together to the English service in the
chapel.&nbsp; Mr Colquhoun preached a simple but impressive sermon from
John x. 4; which text he illustrated by an incident that he had witnessed
in a recent journey northwards.</p>
<p>A shepherd with a flock arrived at a river of some impetuosity.&nbsp; He
entered it first, trying the depths with his staff, got over at the best
place, and then with his voice called over the sheep to him.&nbsp; From
which the following points were deduced:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the shepherd led the way, and the flock waited for his
call.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the sheep followed when he called, although not all of
them at the precise ford he had discovered.&nbsp; Some of them trusted to
their own judgment, and these generally got out of their depths for a
time.&nbsp; His way was certainly the best one.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That as the shepherd stood on the opposite bank, he showed no
symptoms of uneasiness, for he was confident that every one of the flock
would get safely across.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That the sheep in passing over used each his own efforts to get
across, apparently just as much as if there were no one present to help;
although no doubt the presence of the shepherd had a good effect upon their
exertions.&nbsp; It is beyond our reach to explain the metaphysical mystery
of this.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The shepherd in first crossing the stream <!-- page 395--><a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>himself tested the
force of the stream.&nbsp; Each individual creature had to do the same; but
those who followed the closest upon his track had an easy passage, while
those who tried new ways for themselves were some of them swept down the
current for a distance, and had to make hard struggles to rejoin their
companions and to reach the beloved shepherd.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; All got safely over, for they were his sheep; he knew them all
by name; he had tried the way before them and shown it; he then called them
to himself.</p>
<p>Of course each of these points was made use of as personally applicable
to the hearers.&nbsp; The sermon did me much good from its quiet and
truthful character.</p>
<p>At this service, it is needless to observe, that there was no separation
of sexes in the congregation.&nbsp; The girls of the school (who are all
taught English) were there placed by themselves, and prettily dressed,
wearing the Oriental <i>iz&acirc;r</i>, (or large white veil,) with
flowered borders, a novelty to us.</p>
<p>Returning to the mission-house, the late afternoon and the time of
sunset and twilight were spent in rational conversation of Christian
character.&nbsp; And such was our Sabbath-day of devotion and repose.</p>
<p>How glorious were the colours spread over the vast extent of mountain
and sea, modified by length of shadows as the sun declined!&nbsp; Oh how
<!-- page 396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>deep are such beauties and the perception of their value laid in
the innermost recesses of our soul&rsquo;s nature, only to be completely
gratified in the eternity to come.&nbsp; Here, below, we have gorgeous
tints differing in succession, even after actual sunset, to be followed by
a delicate after-glow, which again gives place to the splendour of
night.&nbsp; And as in earth, so in heaven, with the exception of night;
for surely there will be alternations of beauteous scenes above; surely
there will be developments and variety in light, colour, music, harmony,
and the rest of those &ldquo;pleasures for evermore,&rdquo; which are
everywhere emanations from the direct love of &ldquo;Him who first loved
us,&rdquo;&mdash;His gifts, who even here bestows prismatic hues upon
icebergs in the arctic circle, and a rosy flush to the peaks of Jebel
Sanneen in the Lebanon.</p>
<p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Letters were brought at a late hour last night in
four hours from Bayroot, giving recent intelligence from our
fleet&mdash;all political affairs going on successfully.</p>
<p>Everybody speaks well of our host the governor, and his family.&nbsp; He
is a studious man, and has acquired from the Americans a good deal of
history and general knowledge; his youngest brother attends the
natural-history class of the mission-school.&nbsp; He is a relative of the
famous Abu Neked, and his wife (Druses have but one wife each) is of the
Jonbl&acirc;t family.&nbsp; The ancestral mansion he inhabits was built by
one of the <!-- page 397--><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>ancient race called the T&rsquo;noohh, who flourished there from
the 10th to the 17th century, and artists had been brought for the purpose
from Constantinople; the symmetry of the masonry is admirable, and
consequently the shadows formed from it are particularly straight and sharp
in outline.</p>
<p>The village contains specimens of every form of religion to be found
throughout the Lebanon; each sect, however, keeps somewhat apart from the
rest, which practice being common in the mountain, may account for the
villages appearing to a stranger to consist of separate pieces not quite
joined together.</p>
<p>Some women still wear horns, although the Christian clergy set
themselves strongly against these ornaments; some even refusing the
Communion-Sacrament to those who persist in retaining that heathenish
emblem derived from ancient mythology.</p>
<p>Among the Druse men, the &rsquo;Ak&acirc;l are not so marked in their
difference of costume from the Juh&acirc;l as formerly, except in the
extreme cleanliness and careful plaiting of the white turban.&nbsp; My
host, notwithstanding the antiquity of his family and his studious
character, is not one of the initiated, he is but a J&acirc;hel, yet he
probably serves his people best in that capacity, as he is thereby enabled
to hold government employments.</p>
<p>From his windows we could see on the south side of Ras Bayroot several
small vessels engaged <!-- page 398--><a name="page398"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 398</span>in sponge-fishing; the crews of these are
generally Greeks from the islands: yesterday with the telescope we had a
good view of the mail-steamer arriving.</p>
<p>We went to take leave of the American friends, who showed us some
excellent specimens of English writing, and of drawing from the
girls&rsquo; school.</p>
<p>Returning to the Druse friends, I visited Seleem, a brother of the
Bek.&nbsp; On hearing that we were proceeding to Mokht&acirc;rah,
Naam&acirc;n, (brother of Sa&iuml;d Bek Jonbl&acirc;t,) who has retired
from worldly affairs, and become a devout &rsquo;Akal, requested one of my
party to ask Sa&iuml;d to send him some orange-flower water.&nbsp; I have
no doubt that this message (&Phi;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;
&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&#941;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&nu;) covered
some political meaning.</p>
<p>The house of Seleem was simplicity and neatness in the extreme, the only
ornamentation being that of rich robes, pistols, swords, and the silver
decorations of horses, suspended on pegs round the principal apartment; all
thoroughly Oriental of olden time.</p>
<p>The Christian secretary of the Bek attended us to <i>Cuf&rsquo;r
Natta</i> on a fine Jilfi mare, where he got for us a pedestrian guide to
Dair el Kamar.&nbsp; A very deep valley lay before us, into which we had to
descend, lounging leftwards, and then to mount the opposite hill, returning
rightwards, to an elevation higher than that of Cuf&rsquo;r Natta.&nbsp;
Down we went by zigzags through groves of pine that were stirred gently on
their tops by the mountain breeze, <!-- page 399--><a
name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>and there was plenty
of wild myrtle on the ground; we frequently met with specimens of iron ore,
and pink or yellow metallic streaks in the rocks, to the river
Suff&acirc;r, being the upper part of the river that is called Damoor upon
the sea-coast.&nbsp; This is crossed by the bridge <i>Jisr&rsquo; el
K&acirc;di</i>, (so named from an ameer of the house of T&rsquo;noohh,
surnamed the K&acirc;di, or Judge, from his legal acquirements, and who
erected the bridge in old times,) near which the limestone rock of the
water-bed is worn into other channels by the occasional escapements of
winter torrents.&nbsp; There are mills adjoining.</p>
<p>We all rested in a coffee-station at the end of the bridge.&nbsp;
Several parties of muleteers had halted there at the same time.&nbsp; By
the little fireside a large hawk was perched, and the owner of the place
had his apparatus for shoemaking in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>Flowering oleander and fruit trees imparted liveliness to the scene
outside, our several parties in variegated costumes adding not a little to
the same.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, (which is level, and has no side parapets,) we
commenced the great ascent; the hill-side was largely planted with
sherabeen, (sprouts,) of a kind of cedar, not the real cedar of
Lebanon.&nbsp; At a spring half way up we found a poor Turkish infantry
soldier resting all alone, he was a pitiable object in a district so
unfriendly to him.</p>
<p><!-- page 400--><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>What a different country would Palestine or all Syria be were it
like the Lebanon, industriously cultivated inch by inch!&nbsp; How
different would the Lebanon be were this industry and its produce never
interrupted by intestine warfare!</p>
<p>Higher still we saw a train of shaikhs on horseback, attended by men on
foot, coming in our direction longitudinally on the opposite hill from a
remote village.</p>
<p>All the distance, I think, from Jis&rsquo;r el K&acirc;di forwards,
notwithstanding the steep nature of the country, was over a paved or made
road.&nbsp; There is no such a thing in the south; here, however, the
desolation of Turkish rule is but little known, and the people are not only
industrious, but a fine muscular race.</p>
<p>We overtook small groups of village people who had, it seems, gone out
to meet the important riding party lately seen by us.&nbsp; Suddenly, at a
turn of the road, the cheerful town of Dair el Kamar opened out to view,
with the hills and palaces of Beteddeen behind.&nbsp; This was at three
hours from &rsquo;Abeih, exclusive of the hour&rsquo;s rest at the
bridge.</p>
<p>The town appeared to be well built, better than many a European town,
notwithstanding the destruction arising from recent warfare, and the people
cleanly; it was, however, no proof of the latter quality that I saw a pig
being fed at a house-door as we passed along.</p>
<p><!-- page 401--><a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>We alighted at the best Arab house I had ever entered, namely,
that of the influential Mesh&acirc;kah family.&nbsp; After some repose the
host took me and the friends who had accompanied me from Soor and Saida to
look about the town.&nbsp; Through streets and bazaars we came to a large
open place occupied by silk weavers at work, among whom was the father of
Faris, the Arabic teacher in the Protestant school at Jerusalem, he having
been instructed by the Americans at &rsquo;Abeih, and whose sister I had
seen there the day preceding.&nbsp; The silk stuffs of the town maintain a
respectable rivalry with those of Damascus.</p>
<p>Turkish soldiers were dawdling about the streets.</p>
<p>We called at some Christian houses, in one of which (very handsome, with
a garden) the recesses in the wall of one side of the divan room,
containing bedding as usual in the East, were screened by a wide curtain of
white muslin spangled with gold.&nbsp; Upon the other sides of the room
were rude fresco paintings.&nbsp; Opposite the door on entering was the
Virgin and Child; over the door was a dove with an olive branch; and the
remaining side was embellished by the picture of a fine water-melon, with a
slice cut off and lying at its side, the knife still upright in the melon,
and an angel flying above it, blowing a trumpet!</p>
<p>The town is romantically situated upon successive levels of terraces in
the hill, and environed by orchards of fruit.&nbsp; As evening approached,
the <!-- page 402--><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>opposite hill was suffused in a glow of pink, followed by purple
light, and the Ramad&acirc;n gun was fired from Beteddeen when the
sun&rsquo;s orb dropped upon the horizon.&nbsp; Suddenly the hills
exchanged their warm colours for a cold gray, in harmony with the gloaming
or evening twilight.</p>
<p>The population of Dair el Kamar at that time numbered 700 full-grown men
of Maronites, 220 of Greek Catholics, 150 of Druses, with a few Moslems and
Jews&mdash;each of the sects living apart from the rest.&nbsp; The silk
manufacture was more extensive than that of Saida, and a constant
communication was kept up with Damascus, which is at twenty hours&rsquo;
distance.&nbsp; The Christians are far more hardy than their
fellow-Christians the Maronites are in their special district to the
north.&nbsp; The whole population is industrious, and the Druses maintain
their characteristic steadfastness of purpose, secrecy, and union among
themselves.</p>
<p>The house in which I was so hospitably received had been almost entirely
destroyed in the war of 1841; and its proprietor (brother of the two
brothers now its owners) shot dead in his own court, by persons who owed
him money, namely, the Druse party of Abu Neked, two hundred of whom had
for a fortnight lived at free quarters there.</p>
<p>The two brothers who were my hosts are Christians of the Greek Catholic
sect, named Gabriel and Raphael.&nbsp; A third surviving brother is the
<!-- page 403--><a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
403</span>talented Protestant controversialist residing in Damascus, and
practising medicine as learned from the Americans.&nbsp; The one who was
shot by the Druses was Andrew; the eldest of all is Ibrahim, settled in
Bayroot, and his son named Khaleel is dragoman of the English consulate
there&mdash;it was he who furnished us with the introduction to this house
in Dair el Kamar.</p>
<p>How curious is the domestic life of these Oriental families.&nbsp;
Eating takes place in the principal room, with a throng of women and
children passing heedlessly about, or visitors entering as they
please.&nbsp; Among these, during the dinner time, came in a Jew speaking
Jewish-German.&nbsp; He was a dyer, who had known me at Jerusalem, and
conversed with remarkable self-possession: it seemed as if the mountain
air, and absence from the Rabbis of Jerusalem, had made a man of him.&nbsp;
In attendance on the meal was an ancient woman-servant of the family, very
wrinkled, but wearing the tantoor or horn on her head.</p>
<p>On retiring from the table, if we may use that expression as applicable
to an Oriental dinner, there came in the Greek Catholic Bishop of Saida,
and several heads of houses of the Maronites, on visits of ceremony.</p>
<p>The fatigue of the day was closed, and rewarded by a night of sleep upon
a bed of down and crimson silk, under a covering of the same.</p>
<p>In the morning our journey was resumed; but <!-- page 404--><a
name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>before quitting this
interesting town, I cannot forbear quoting Dr Porter&rsquo;s admirable
description of Dair el Kamar, from Murray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook for Syria
and Palestine,&rdquo; part ii. page 413:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deir el Kamr is a picturesque mountain village, or rather town,
of some 8000 inhabitants, whose houses are built along a steep, rocky
hill-side.&nbsp; A sublime glen runs beneath it, and on the opposite side,
on a projecting ledge, stands the palace of Btedd&icirc;n.&nbsp; Both the
banks, as well as the slopes above them, are covered with terraces,
supporting soil on which a well-earned harvest waves in early summer, amid
rows of mulberries and olives and straggling vines.&nbsp; Industry has here
triumphed over apparent impossibilities, having converted naked rocky
declivities into a paradise.&nbsp; In Palestine we have passed through vast
plains of the richest soil all waste and desolate&mdash;here we see the
mountain&rsquo;s rugged side clothed with soil not its own, and watered by
a thousand rills led captive from fountains far away.&nbsp; Every spot on
which a handful of soil can rest, every cranny to which a vine can cling,
every ledge on which a mulberry can stand, is occupied.&nbsp; The people
too, now nearly all Christians, have a thrifty well-to-do look, and the
children, thanks to the energy of the American missionaries, are well
taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was in 1857, and the description corresponds to what I witnessed in
1853; but, alas! how great a change ensued in 1860.&nbsp; I must <!-- page
405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>refrain,
however, from enlarging upon the melancholy tragedy that occurred there
during the insurrection of that memorable year.</p>
<p>First we went to Beteddeen, and witnessed the sad spectacle of the Ameer
Besheer&rsquo;s luxurious palace in a process of daily destruction by the
Turkish soldiery, who occupied it as a barrack.&nbsp; Accounts had been
read by me in Europe <a name="citation405"></a><a href="#footnote405"
class="citation">[405]</a> of its size and costliness, but the description
had not exceeded the reality.</p>
<p>The officer in command gave us permission to be guided over the palatial
courts and chambers.&nbsp; We wandered through the Hhareem-rooms, and saw
baths of marble and gilding, sculptured inscriptions in the passages,
coloured mosaics in profusion on the floors, painted roofs, rich columns,
brass gates, carved doors, marble fountains, and basins with gold
fish.&nbsp; We entered the state reception room, and the old ameer&rsquo;s
little business div&acirc;n, in a balcony commanding a view of the
approaches in every direction, of the meid&acirc;n for equestrian practice,
of the inner courts, of the gardens below, and of a cascade of water
rolling over lofty cliffs, at the exact distance whence the sound came
gently soothing the ear, and from that spot also was obtained a distant
view of the Mediterranean; not omitting the advantage of witnessing <!--
page 406--><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>every
important movement that could be made in the streets of Dair el Kamar,
across the deep valley.</p>
<p>Beteddeen had been a truly princely establishment, but now adds one more
lesson to the many others of instability in human greatness.&nbsp; Fourteen
years before, it was all in its glory&mdash;the courts were thronged with
Druse and Maronite chiefs arrayed in cloth of gold, with soldiers, with
secretaries, with flatterers and suppliants; whereas now, before our eyes,
the dirty canaille of Turkish soldiers were tearing up marble squares of
pavement to chuck about for sport, doors were plucked down and burned, even
the lightning-rods were demolished, and every species of devastation
practised for passing away their idle time.</p>
<p>I shall not here describe the political movements that led to this great
reverse of fortune, or to the present condition of the family of
Shehab.</p>
<p>The mountains around were still in careful cultivation, chiefly with the
vine and olive; and the aqueduct still brings water from the springs of
Suff&acirc;r at several miles&rsquo; distance, and this it is which, after
supplying the palace, forms the cascade above described, and afterwards
turns two mills.</p>
<p>At short distances are smaller palaces, erected also by this powerful
ameer for his mother and his married sons; but the same fate has overtaken
them all&mdash;Turkish devastation.</p>
<p><!-- page 407--><a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
407</span>Before leaving the place, I visited the tomb of the ameer&rsquo;s
mother and that of his principal wife, who was a Christian; they are near
the house, and surrounded by five cypresses.</p>
<p>Took the road towards Mokht&acirc;rah, the seat of the rival chief, the
Druse Jonbl&acirc;t.&nbsp; For some distance after Beteddeen the roads have
been carefully constructed, over an unusually level plateau for the
Lebanon; but an enormous ridge of mountain stands conspicuous in the
N.-E.&nbsp; This is the highest part of the Shoof, near the sources of the
river <i>Barook</i>, so named from being the first place where the Arab
camels <i>knelt</i> on arriving in the Lebanon in A.D. 821.&nbsp; The sad
spectacle of villages and good farm-houses desolate and blackened by fire,
frequently met the view; for this open tract, called the
<i>Sumkan&icirc;yeh</i>, has frequently been a scene of conflict between
the leading factions; it was especially the ground of the considerable
battle of the Ameer Besheer and the Jonblat&icirc;yeh in 1825.&nbsp; At
length, from the commencement of a descent, we saw Mokht&acirc;rah upon an
opposite hill, commanding the view of our approach&mdash;a great advantage
in times of warfare.&nbsp; Our road lay downwards by odd turns and twists,
and over a precipice to the river Barook, with its romantic banks and
fruit-trees peering between overhanging rocks.</p>
<p>On our arrival, the great man, Said Bek <!-- page 408--><a
name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>Jonbl&acirc;t, <a
name="citation408"></a><a href="#footnote408" class="citation">[408]</a>
came out with a train of &rsquo;Ak&acirc;l councillors and a crowd of
humbler retainers.&nbsp; He was a handsome man of about twenty-eight, and
richly apparelled.&nbsp; Beneath a large abai or cloak of black Cashmere,
with Indian patterns embroidered about the collar and skirts, he wore a
long gombaz of very dark green silk embossed with tambour work; his sash
was of the plainest purple silk, and his sidr&icirc;yeh or vest was of
entire cloth of gold with gold filigree buttons: on the head a plain
tarboosh, and in his hand sometimes a cane ornamented with ivory or a
rosary of sandal-wood.&nbsp; His gold watch and chain were in the best
European taste.</p>
<p>I need not here expatiate on the sumptuous reception afforded us; it may
be enough to say, that having some hours to spare before sunset&mdash;the
universal time for dinner in the East&mdash;we walked about, and the Bek
shewed me the yet unrepaired damages, inflicted in his father&rsquo;s time,
at the hands of the victorious Ameer Besheer&rsquo;s faction, on that
palace and paradise which his father Besheer had created there, thus
teaching the Sheh&acirc;b Ameer how to build its rival of
Beteddeen,&mdash;and the limpid stream brought from the high sources of the
Barook to supply cascades and fountains for the marble courts, which the
other also imitated in bringing down the Suff&acirc;r to his place.&nbsp;
We sat <!-- page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
409</span>beside those streams and cascades, so grateful at that season of
the year, conversing about the Arab factions of Kaisi and Yemeni, or the
Jonbl&acirc;t and Yesbeck parties of the Druses, or his own early years
spent in exile either in the Hauran or with Mohammed &rsquo;Ali in
Egypt,&mdash;but not a word about actual circumstances of the Lebanon, or
about his plans for restoring the palace to more than its former splendour,
which he afterwards carried out.&nbsp; This was all very agreeable, but a
curious fit of policy assumed at the time rendered my host to some degree
apparently inhospitable to us Christians.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Druse religion allows its votaries to profess
outwardly the forms of any other religion according to place and
circumstances.&nbsp; The Bek was now adopting Moslem observances;
consequently, it being the month of Ramad&acirc;n, we could have nothing to
eat till after sunset.&nbsp; What could have been his reason for this
temporary disguisement I have never been able to discover.&nbsp; Even the
ad&acirc;n was cried on the roof of his house, summoning people to prayer
in the canonical formula of the Moslems, and Sa&iuml;d Bek, with his
councillors, retired to a shed for devotional exercises, as their prayers
may be appropriately termed; and I remarked that at every rising attitude
he was lifted reverently by the hands and elbows, by his
attendants,&mdash;an assistance which no true Mohammedan of any rank, that
I had ever met with, would have tolerated.</p>
<p><!-- page 410--><a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>At length the sunlight ceased to gild the lofty peaks above us,
and pipes, sherbet, and ice were served up as a preparation for the coming
dinner.</p>
<p>There is in front of the house a square reservoir of water, with a
current flowing in and out of it; this is bordered by large cypress-trees,
and in a corner near the house wall grows a large acacia-tree, the
light-green colour and drooping foliage of which gave somewhat of an Indian
appearance to the scene.</p>
<p>Lamps were then lit beneath an arcade, and near the water a huge cresset
was filled with resinous pine splinters, and the light of its burning
flickered fantastically over the pool, the house, and the trees.</p>
<p>Next came the dinner, late for the appetites of us travellers, and
tedious in its duration&mdash;with music outside the open windows.</p>
<p>After the meal the Bek withdrew to the corner of his divan for
transaction of business with his people, as the Moslems do at that
season.&nbsp; His part of the affairs consisted in endorsing a word or two
upon the petitions or addresses that were produced by the
secretaries&mdash;these were written on small rolls of paper like tiny
cigarettes, pinched at one end.&nbsp; How very un-European to carry on
business in so few words, either written or spoken!</p>
<p>Sa&iuml;d Bek was a man of few words in such transactions, but what he
did say seemed always to hit exactly the point intended; and the wave of
his <!-- page 411--><a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>finger was sufficient to summon a number of men to receive his
commands.&nbsp; He was evidently a person of a different stamp from the
coarse leaders of Lebanon factions, the Abu Neked, the Shibli el
&rsquo;Ari&acirc;n, and such like; he is proud of his family antiquity,
refined in dress and manners, and has always, like the rest of the Druses,
courted the favour of the English nation.</p>
<p>On the entrance of his son, named Nejib, probably four or five years
old, all the Ak&acirc;l councillors and military officers rose to receive
him.</p>
<p>In the morning we took our departure, when Sa&iuml;d Bek accompanied us
as far as the Meid&acirc;n, and a profusion of Druse compliments filled up
the leave-taking.</p>
<p>We now passed for some hours along the river side, through the utmost
loveliness of Lebanon scenery.&nbsp; Among other trees that lined its
banks, or adorned the precipitous cliffs, or followed the rising and
falling road, were noble specimens of platanus (plane) and lofty
zanzalacht, (the peepul of India;) crystal rills tumbled down the rocks, as
if sparkling alive with enjoyment; then the usual poplar, walnut, evergreen
oak, and a large plantation of olive: the river sometimes smiled with the
fringe of oleander.&nbsp; We halted for a time under a wide-branching
platanus at the end of a bridge, between the masonry of which grew bunches
of the caper plant, then in blossom of white and lilac, and at the piers of
which grew straggling <!-- page 412--><a name="page412"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 412</span>blackberry brambles and wild fig-trees in
picturesque irregularity, while the water bubbled and gurgled over a pebbly
bed or fragments of rock.</p>
<p>Peasantry passed us with ass-loads of wood for fuel, (camels being
unknown in that region.)&nbsp; The same features continually repeated
themselves as we advanced; large broken cliffs were overhanging us, and
birds singing in the solitude; it need not be added that the sun was
cloudless the whole day long.</p>
<p>Forward we went to the Convent of the Dair el Mokhallis, which we
reached in four hours and a half from Mokht&acirc;rah, where we rested a
few hours; then visited once more the house of Lady Hester Stanhope.</p>
<p>Thence descending to the sea beach, we crossed the river Awali, and
looked back with regret to the heights of Lebanon.&nbsp; Just as the last
gun of Ramad&acirc;n was fired, (for it was the termination of that fast
and the commencement of Beiram,) we galloped our horses into the sea-wave
near the walls of Sidon, which they enjoyed as refreshing to their heated
fetlocks, and we found a luxury in the breeze and in the rustling sound of
the endless roll of wavelets upon the shelly beach.</p>
<p>How different were the temperature and the scenery from those of
Mokht&acirc;rah in the early morning!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Even now in the nineteenth century one can <!-- page 413--><a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>understand how it was
that in ancient Bible times the peoples inhabiting those romantic districts
were distinct from each other within a small space, having separate kings
and alien interests, for here in the lapse of few hours I had traversed
regions where the inhabitants differed greatly in religion, in manners,
customs, dress, and physical aspect.&nbsp; The Maronite and the Druse of
Lebanon; the Syrian and the Turk of Bayroot, Saida, and Soor; the
Metaw&acirc;li of the Ph&oelig;nician district, no more resemble each other
than if they were men or women of different nations, as indeed they are by
derivation; each of these is but a fragment of antiquity, representing to
us his several ancient race; yet all these fragments are united for the
present by the slenderest of bonds, those of using one common language, the
Arabic, and of an unwilling subjection to the Ottoman scymitar.</p>
<p>Alas! for the beautiful country thus parcelled out by peoples, who,
cherishing ancient rivalries and modern blood-feuds, have, and can have no
national life, or sentiment of patriotism.</p>
<h2><!-- page 414--><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
414</span>XIII.&nbsp; NORTH-WEST OF THE DEAD SEA.</h2>
<p>In December 1856, I met, by appointment, at Jericho the Rev. A. A.
Isaacs, and my friend James Graham, who were going with photographic
apparatus to take views at the site called Wadi Gumr&acirc;n, near
&rsquo;Ain Feshkah, where a few years before M. de Saulcy, under the
guidance of an ardent imagination, believed he had found extensive and
cyclopean remains of the city Gomorrah, and had published an account of
that interesting discovery.</p>
<p>It was on Christmas eve that we rose early by starlight, and had our
cups of coffee in the open air, beside the <i>Kala&rsquo;at er Reehha</i>,
(Castle of Jericho,) while the tents were being struck and rolled up for
returning to Jerusalem, where we were to meet them at night.</p>
<p>Only the artistic apparatus and a small canteen were to accompany us;
but the muleteer for these was even more dilatory in his preparations than
is usual with his professional brethren&mdash;and that is <!-- page
415--><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>saying much;
no doubt he entertained a dread of visiting the Dead Sea at points out of
the beaten track for travellers; considerable time was also occupied in
getting a stone out of the mule&rsquo;s shoe; then just as that was
triumphantly effected, my mare happened to bolt off free into the
wilderness; when she was recovered, it was ascertained that my cloak was
lost from her back; during the search for this, the guide abandoned us, and
it was with much difficulty that we hired one from Jericho.</p>
<p>At length we commenced the march, leaving the kaww&acirc;s to look for
the cloak, (which, however, he did not succeed in recovering; it would be a
prize for the thieves of the village, or even, if it should fall in their
way, for one of the Bashi-bozuk,) and got to <i>&rsquo;Ain Feshkah</i>,
much in need of a real breakfast.&nbsp; There the water was found to be too
brackish for use&mdash;as unpalatable, probably, as the water of &rsquo;Ain
es Sult&acirc;n was before being healed by the prophet Elisha; so we drank
native wine instead of coffee, while seated among tall reeds of the marshy
ground, and not pleased with the mephitic odour all around us.</p>
<p>Our photographers having ascertained the site for their researches by
means of the guide, and by the indications furnished in the work of De
Saulcy; they set themselves to work, during which they were frequently
uttering ejaculations at the exaggerations of size and quantity made by my
French friend.&nbsp; The cyclopean ruins seemed to <!-- page 416--><a
name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 416</span>us nothing but
remnants of water-courses for irrigation of plantations, such as may be
seen in the neighbourhood of Elisha&rsquo;s fountain, or heaps of boulders,
etc., that had been rolled down from the adjacent cliffs by natural causes
during a succession of ages.</p>
<p>Mr Isaacs has since published a book descriptive of this expedition,
containing illustrations from his photographs taken on the spot.&nbsp; In
this he has given the reasons for our differing from M. de Saulcy, and
considering his theories unfounded.</p>
<p>At the end of a strip of beach, which the discoverer calls &ldquo;the
plain,&rdquo; the cliffs have a narrow crevasse, down which water rushes in
the season when there is water to form a cascade.&nbsp; This is difficult
to reach from &ldquo;the plain,&rdquo; and very narrow; and it is what our
Arabs called the Wadi Gumr&acirc;n.&nbsp; In front of this opening is a
hill with some ruins upon it; thither we mounted easily, and saw vestiges
of some ancient fort with a cistern.</p>
<p>When all the observations were taken upon points considered necessary,
we prepared to return home by way of Mar Saba, hardly expecting to arrive
by daylight at Jerusalem.&nbsp; We were, however, desirous of spending
Christmas day there rather than in the bleak wilderness.</p>
<p>On the way we fortunately got some camel&rsquo;s milk from a party
passing near us.&nbsp; The weather was hot, but exceedingly clear.&nbsp;
The Salt <!-- page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
417</span>mountain of Sodom, (Khash&rsquo;m Usdum,) showed itself well at
the southern extremity of the lake, thirty miles distant; and from a raised
level near its northern end we gained superb views of Mount Hermon (Jebel
esh Shaikh) in the Anti-Lebanon, capped with snow.&nbsp; This was entirely
unexpected and gratifying; but I could nowhere find a spot from which both
Hermon and Sodom could be seen at once.&nbsp; Perhaps such a view may be
had somewhere on the hills.</p>
<p>We turned aside through the <i>Wadi Dubber</i>, as the guide termed it,
within a circuitous winding, out of which, at a spot called &rsquo;Ain
Merubba&rsquo;, I had passed a night in the open air some years before.</p>
<p>Long, dreary, and tiresome was the journey; the two Bashi-bozuk men
complained of it as much as we did.&nbsp; At sunset we came to a well with
some water left in troughs near it, but not enough for all our horses, and
we had no means of getting more out of the well.&nbsp; This was in a wide,
treeless, trackless wilderness.</p>
<p>No one of our party felt quite sure of being on the true road, but we
followed slight tracks in the general direction in which the convent lay;
we guessed and went on.&nbsp; Occasionally we got sight of the summit of
the Frank mountain or lost it again, according to the rise or fall of the
ground.&nbsp; Conversation flagged; but at length we struck up a Christmas
hymn to enliven us.</p>
<p><!-- page 418--><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
418</span>In the valley of Mar Saba we saw lights in the convent, but
passed on.&nbsp; Saw an Arab encampment, with fire and lights glimmering,
where the dogs came out to bark at us; another such in half an hour more;
and a larger camp in another half-hour, where men were discussing matters
with much vociferation in a cavern by a blazing fire; a scout called out,
inquiring if we were friends or foes?</p>
<p>The night grew very cold, and I should have been glad had my cloak not
been lost near Jericho.&nbsp; The temperature differed greatly from that of
the Dead Sea&mdash;a keen wind was in keeping with the end of
December.&nbsp; The stars were most brilliant: Venus richly lustrous;
Sirius, dazzling; and the huge Orion showing to best advantage.&nbsp; The
road was alternately rough in the valley, or over slippery ledges.&nbsp; At
length, however, we got cheered by coming to known objects.&nbsp; Passed
Beer Eyoob, (En Rogel,) and saw the battlemented walls of the Holy City
sharply marked against the sky.</p>
<p>The key had been left by the authorities at the city gate, to allow of
our admission; but the rusty lock required a long time for turning it, and
the heavy hinges of the large gate moved very slowly, at least so it seemed
in our impatience to reach home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It is said above that I once spent a night at the &rsquo;Ain
Merubba&rsquo;&mdash;this was on the occasion of an attempt, which ended in
failure, to reach &rsquo;Ain Jidi <!-- page 419--><a
name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 419</span>(En-gaddi) from the
&rsquo;Ain Feshkah in the common way of travelling. <a
name="citation419"></a><a href="#footnote419"
class="citation">[419]</a></p>
<p>Hhamdan, Shaikh of the Ta&rsquo;amra, with about a dozen of his men,
escorted me and one kaww&acirc;s in that direction.&nbsp; Instead of
proceeding to Jericho or Elisha&rsquo;s fountain, we turned aside into the
wildest of wildernesses for passing the night.&nbsp; Traversing the length
of an extremely narrow ridge, something like the back of a knife, we
descended to a great depth below; but the risk being judged too great for
conveying the tent and bed over there by the mule, these were left spread
upon the ground for the night under the canopy of heaven; while the men
carried our food for us to make the evening meal.&nbsp; Crawling or
sliding, and leading the horses gently, we got to the bottom, and then
followed up a very narrow glen, winding in and out, and round about between
extraordinary precipices rising to enormous heights, till all at once the
men halted, shouted, and sang, and stripped themselves to bathe in small
pools formed in holes of the rock by settlements of rain-water.</p>
<p>This was our halting-place, but the scene beggars all power of
description.&nbsp; We were shut into a contracted glen by a maze of
tortuous windings, between mountains of yellow marl on either side; but
broken, rugged, naked of all vegetation,&mdash;referring one&rsquo;s
imagination to the period when the <!-- page 420--><a
name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 420</span>earth was yet
&ldquo;without form and void,&rdquo; or to the subsiding of the deluge from
which Noah was delivered.</p>
<p>Looking upwards to a great height we could just see the tops of the
imprisoning hills gilded awhile by the setting sun, and a small space of
blue making up the interval between the precipices.&nbsp; Those precipices
were not, however, entirely yellow, but variegated with occasional red or
somewhat of brown ochre.&nbsp; So fantastic in position or shape were the
masses hurled or piled about, and the place so utterly removed &ldquo;from
humanity&rsquo;s reach,&rdquo; that it might be imagined suitable to mould
the genius of Martin into the most extravagant conceptions of chaos, or to
suggest the colouring of Turner without his indistinctness of outline.</p>
<p>The echoes of the men&rsquo;s voices and bursts of laughter (the latter
so uncommon among Arabs) when splashing in the water, were reverberated
from hill to hill and back again; but there were no wild birds among the
rocks to scream in rejoinder as at Petra.</p>
<p>After a time a voice was heard from above, very high, (it is wonderful
how far the human voice is carried in that pure atmosphere and in such a
locality,) and on looking up I saw a dark speck against the sky waving his
arms about.&nbsp; It was one of the Ta&rsquo;amra asking if he should bring
down my mattress.&nbsp; Consent was given, and, behold, down came tumbling
from rock to rock the <!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 421</span>mattress and blanket tied up into a parcel;
when approaching near us, it was taken up by the man who followed it, and
carried on his back; and when still nearer to us it was carefully borne
between two men.&nbsp; Thus I enjoyed the distinction above all the rest of
having a mattress to lie upon; the shaikh had a couple of cloaks, the
kaww&acirc;s had one, and the others were utterly without such luxurious
accessories, and slept profoundly.</p>
<p>Our people called the place <i>&rsquo;Ain Merubba&rsquo;</i>, (the
square fountain.)&nbsp; I saw no fountain of any form, but there must have
been one, for we had a supply of good water, and the designation
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ain,&rdquo; or fountain, is one of too serious importance to
be employed for any but its literal signification.</p>
<p>Very early in the morning we started afresh, and took the beach of the
lake towards &rsquo;Ain Feshkah.</p>
<p>A great part of the day was spent in clambering our ponies over broken
rocks of a succession of promontories, one following another, where it
seemed that no creatures but goats could make way; the Arabs protesting all
the while that the attempt was hopeless, and besides, that the distance
even over better ground was too great for one day&rsquo;s march.</p>
<p>At length I relinquished the undertaking to reach &rsquo;Ain Jidi by
that way, and for that year had no leisure from business to try it from
other directions.</p>
<p><!-- page 422--><a name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
422</span>Hhamdan and I sat on a rock in his free open air dominion,
discussing possibilities, and what &rsquo;Ain Jidi was like, as well as the
&ldquo;Ladder of Ter&acirc;beh,&rdquo; (see p. 334.)&nbsp; At length we
rose and turned towards Jerusalem.&nbsp; I am not sure that I ever saw him
again, for not long afterwards he was drowned in the Jordan while
attempting to swim his horse through the stream at its highest, after
assisting in a battle on the side of the D&euml;ab &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n.</p>
<h2><!-- page 423--><a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
423</span>XIV.&nbsp; SOBA.</h2>
<p>On the crest of a high hill two or three hours west from Jerusalem,
stands the village of Soba, and it has long been imagined to be Modin, the
birth-place and burial-place of the Maccab&aelig;an heroes; though I never
heard any reason assigned for that identification, except the circumstance
of the sea being visible from it, and therefore of its being visible from
the sea, which was supposed to tally with the description given in 1 Macc.
xiii., 27-30, of the monuments erected there,&mdash;&ldquo;Simon also built
a monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it
aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before.&nbsp; Moreover, he
set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother,
and his four brethren.&nbsp; And in these he made cunning devices, about
the which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their
armour for a perpetual memory; and by the armour ships carved, that they
might be seen of all that sail on the sea.&nbsp; This is the <!-- page
424--><a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 424</span>sepulchre
which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet unto this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never was persuaded that the words implied that ships carved on
pillars at Soba, could be distinguished from the sea, or even that the
columns themselves were visible from ships off the coast; but only this,
that the deliverers of their country from the intolerable yoke of the
Syrians, having opened up communication with the Grecians and Romans,
marine intercourse had become more frequent than before, a matter that the
Maccab&aelig;an family were proud of; and therefore they had ships carved
on the pillars, as might be observed by seafaring people who might go
there; yet, whatever the words might signify, they could not prove that
Modin was so far inland, and among the hills, as Soba.</p>
<p>However, in 1858, I went with my son and a couple of friends to inspect
the place itself, considering it at least worth while to make one&rsquo;s
own observations on the spot.</p>
<p>We passed through <i>&rsquo;Ain Carem</i>, the <i>Karem</i> of the
Septuagint, to <i>Satt&acirc;f</i>, and rested during the heat of the day
in a vineyard, near a spring of water and plots of garden vegetables,
belonging to the few houses that had been rebuilt after several years of
devastation by village warfare.</p>
<p>The approach to the place from any direction is through the very rough
torrent bed of the Wadi Bait Hhaneena, and along very narrow ledges <!--
page 425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 425</span>upon
the sides of steep hills, quite as perilous as any that are used for
travelling in any part of the Lebanon; too dangerous to admit of
dismounting and leading the horse after the risk has once begun, by far the
safest method of advancing is to hold the reins very loose, and if you wish
it, to shut your eyes.</p>
<p>Opposite to Satt&acirc;f, directly across the valley, the Latins had
lately rebuilt a small chapel of former times, said to have been the prison
of John the Baptist; they name it the Chapel of the <i>Hhabees</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, the imprisoned one.</p>
<p>Leaving Satt&acirc;f we gradually ascended to Soba; at first through
lemon and orange plantations near the water, and then through vineyards
with a few pomegranate-trees interspersed.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy how, throughout most of the tribe of Judah, small
springs of water are found dribbling from the rocks, (besides the larger
sources of Urtas, Lifta, Faghoor &rsquo;Aroob, Dirweh, and Hebron,) which
were doubtless more copious in the ancient times, when the land was more
clothed with timber, and there were men, industrious men, aware of their
blessings, and ready to prevent the streams from slipping away beneath the
seams of limestone formation.</p>
<p>At Soba we mounted the steep hill to the <i>Shooneh</i>, or small
look-out tower at the summit, enjoying the breadth of landscape and the
stretch of the Mediterranean before our eyes.</p>
<p><!-- page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
426</span>In the village we found remains of old masonry, most likely the
basement of a fortification of early Saracenic or the Crusaders&rsquo; era;
besides which there was a piece of wall in excellent condition of the best
character of Jewish rabbeted stones.</p>
<p>One man invited us to see some old stones inside of his house; but they
formed a portion of the basement above-mentioned, against which the rest of
his house was built.&nbsp; The people were unanimous in declaring that
there was nothing else of such a nature in the village.&nbsp; So that our
researches issued in no corroboration of Soba being Modin.</p>
<p>Leaving the place we descended to the high road of Jaffa to Jerusalem,
and saw a number of olive-trees dead of age; none of us, however long
resident in Palestine, had seen such before or elsewhere; we concluded them
to have been withered by age from their bearing no visible tokens of
destruction, while the ground was well ploughed around them, and from
finding others near them in progressive stages of decay, down to the utter
extinction of foliage.</p>
<p>Arrived at <i>Kal&ocirc;neh</i> upon the highway, certainly the site of
a Roman garrison or &ldquo;colonia,&rdquo; (see Acts xvi. 12,) leaving
Kustul behind, which is also a derivation from the Latin word for a
castle.</p>
<p>Near the bridge of Kal&ocirc;neh, where there are good specimens of
ancient rabbeted stones, one gets a glimpse of &rsquo;Ain Carem through the
olive <!-- page 427--><a name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
427</span>plantation; and the return that day was by a cross way from
<i>Dair Yaseen</i> through vineyards to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It is only at a comparatively late period that attention has been
directed to the text of Eusebius and Jerome in the
&ldquo;Onomasticon,&rdquo; where it is distinctly said that Modin was near
Lydd, and that the monuments were at that time (in the fourth century)
still shown there.</p>
<p>Porter considers that therefore <i>Latroon</i> is the true site of
Modin: in this supposition I wish to concur; for the general run of the
Maccab&aelig;an history becomes peculiarly intelligible when read with the
idea in the mind that Modin lay in just such a situation, namely, upon a
hill, rising alone from the great plain, but adjacent to the mountain
ridge, and to defiles into which the insurgents might easily retire, or
from which they might issue suddenly and surprise regular armies in their
camp.&nbsp; I know of no place so suitable for such operations as
Latroon.</p>
<p>The word
&epsilon;&pi;&nu;&gamma;&epsilon;&gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&mu;&#941;&nu;&alpha;,
used for the armour and the ships, must mean &ldquo;carved in
relievo,&rdquo; and such objects could never be distinguished by persons
actually passing upon the sea, if placed either at Soba, Latroon, Lydd, or
even Jaffa; it is difficult enough to imagine that the pyramids and columns
were visible from the sea at Latroon.</p>
<h2><!-- page 428--><a name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
428</span>XV.&nbsp; THE TWO BAIT SAHHOORS IDENTIFIED WITH BETHSURA AND BATH
ZACHARIAS.</h2>
<p>There are two villages in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem bearing the
name of Bait Sahhoor.&nbsp; One lies near to the city, beyond En-Rogel, a
little way down the valley of the Kedron; the other is farther off, close
under Bethlehem.&nbsp; By way of distinction, the former is called
&ldquo;Bait Sahhoor of the W&acirc;di,&rdquo; and the latter, &ldquo;Bait
Sahhoor of the Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think that it can be shown that
these places, though now fallen from their high estate, once played their
part in important events,&mdash;that Bait Sahhoor of the W&acirc;di is
identical with Bethsura,&mdash;and that Bait Sahhoor of the Christians is
identical with Bath Zacharias&mdash;both of Maccab&aelig;an history.</p>
<p>In the year 150 of the Seleucidan era, being the fifth year of the
liberty of Zion, (the term used upon the Maccab&aelig;an coins,) a vast
army of Syrians invaded Palestine from Antioch, headed by King Antiochus
Eupator, in the twelfth year of his age, and under the official command of
Lysias, one of <!-- page 429--><a name="page429"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 429</span>his relatives.&nbsp; The army consisted of
both subjects and hired aliens, even from the islands of the sea.&nbsp;
They numbered &ldquo;a hundred thousand infantry, and twenty thousand
cavalry, with thirty-two elephants exercised in battle,&rdquo; (I Macc. vi.
30.)</p>
<p>The object of the expedition was to crush the Maccab&aelig;an
insurrection, and wipe out the disgrace of defeats already sustained.&nbsp;
The first attempt was to be the relief of the garrison at Jerusalem, which
was at this time beleaguered by Judas from the temple part of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The army was very great and mighty,&rdquo; (ver. 41.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;When the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains
glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire,&rdquo; (ver. 39.)&nbsp;
Each of the thirty-two elephants was attended by &ldquo;a thousand men
armed with coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and
besides this, for every beast was ordained five hundred horsemen of the
best&mdash;these were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beast was,
and whithersoever the beast went they went also, neither departed they from
him; and upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, which covered
every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with devices; there were
upon every one thirty-two strong men that fought upon them, beside the
Indian that ruled him,&rdquo; (ver. 35, etc.)</p>
<p>This strange host marched along the Philistine plain southwards to
Idumea, which is on the south <!-- page 430--><a name="page430"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 430</span>of Hebron: this being the only way for such an
army and its elephants to get at Jerusalem.&nbsp; Thence they swept the
land before them northwards, &ldquo;and pitched against Bethsura, which
they assaulted many days, making engines of war, but they of the city came
out and fought valiantly,&rdquo; (ver. 31.)</p>
<p>Whereupon Judas desisted from his siege of the citadel&mdash;which, I
may remark in passing, must have been on Acra, not like David&rsquo;s
citadel taken from the Jebusites, on Zion&mdash;and hastened to attack the
royal host, mighty though it was.</p>
<p>Some have supposed that Bethsura is to be found at Bait Zur, near
Hebron, the Beth Zur of Josh. xv. 33; whereas this place is more than a
hundred furlongs from Jerusalem, being not much more than an hour (north)
from Hebron, and is altogether too far removed to answer the description of
Bethsura, and the operations carried on there, close to the Holy City.</p>
<p>The 5th verse of the 11th chapter of 2 Maccabees sets the whole question
at rest; the words are distinctly, &ldquo;So he (Lysias) came to Judea and
drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from Jerusalem
<i>about five furlongs</i>, and he laid sore siege unto it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again, immediately after taking the city of Jerusalem and dedicating the
temple, Judas &ldquo;fortified Bethsura in order to preserve it,&rdquo;
(that is, Mount Zion,) that the people might have a defence against Idumea,
(I Macc. iv. 61.)&nbsp; And the accusation which had been formerly <!--
page 431--><a name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 431</span>made to
the King Antiochus Epiphanes in Persia against Judas and his men was
&ldquo;that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls as
before, and his city Bethsura;&rdquo; also to the present king at Antioch,
&ldquo;that the sanctuary also and Bethsura have they fortified,&rdquo;
(chap. vi. 7, 26.)&nbsp; It is clear that one was an outwork of the other,
Bethsura being the defence of Jerusalem against incursions from the
south.</p>
<p>I know not how to doubt that Bait Sahhoor of the valley is the very
place.&nbsp; It lies upon a lofty hill across the valley not far beyond
En-Rogel.&nbsp; This is at present a wretched village, only inhabited for a
few weeks in the year; but the position is naturally one of great
strength.&nbsp; The distance from the city answers precisely the
requirements of the history,&mdash;a signal by trumpet, if not the human
voice, could be heard from one garrison to the other.&nbsp; I have ridden
repeatedly to the spot and examined the ground.&nbsp; The south-eastern
angle of the temple wall at Jerusalem (where the great stones are found) is
distinctly visible from the houses.&nbsp; I sat there upon my horse and
remarked how unassailable by cavalry and elephants this site must have
been, and how great its value for a military outwork to the sanctuary of
the temple.&nbsp; The pediment and moulding of a column lay at my
feet,&mdash;around and opposite across the valley were numerous sepulchres
hewn in the solid rock; yet the infantry of the Syrians were sufficient to
<!-- page 432--><a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
432</span>overwhelm the gallant defenders.&nbsp; Judas in this emergency
resolved to come to their relief, raising the siege of the citadel and
outflanking the enemy.&nbsp; For this purpose he &ldquo;pitched at Bath
Zacharias over against the king&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; (ver. 32.)&nbsp; This
was seventy stadia, or nearly nine Roman, or eight and a half English miles
distant from Bethsura, (Josephus&rsquo; Antiq. xii. 9, 4.)&nbsp; I believe
Bath Zacharias to be the village which now bears the name of &ldquo;Bait
Sahhoor of the Christians,&rdquo; close to Bethlehem. <a
name="citation432"></a><a href="#footnote432"
class="citation">[432]</a>&nbsp; I have ridden over the space between the
two villages called Bait Sahhoor; the distance upon a well marked and
rather winding road, answers well to the description of the
historian.&nbsp; The stratagem of Judas becomes here very intelligible,
which was to take the invaders in the rear, and placing them between two
hostile Jewish forces, to draw away the main attack from Bethsura and
Jerusalem; besides cutting off any assistance from the south.&nbsp;
Antiochus did face round in order to attack him, and was met in narrow
straits between the two localities.&nbsp; This I take to be the broken
ground south-east of Mar Elias, where certainly it would be just as
impossible now for two elephants to go abreast as it was when Josephus
wrote his lively <!-- page 433--><a name="page433"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 433</span>description of the engagement that ensued; of
the shouts of the men echoing among the mountains, and the glitter of the
rising sun upon the polished accoutrements.&nbsp; It was summer, for they
excited the elephants with the blood of the grape and the mulberry.&nbsp;
The road is to this day defined by true tokens of antiquity, such as lines
of stones covered with hoary lichen, old cisterns, especially a noble one
called the <i>Beer el Kott</i>, with here and there steps cut in the
shelves of solid rock.&nbsp; The last part of the road on the south is
among slippery, rocky, narrow defiles and paths, half-way down the
hill-sides.</p>
<p>Here six hundred of the Syrian army were cut off and Eleazar, the heroic
brother of Judas, was crushed under an elephant which he had killed.&nbsp;
Yet the fortune of the day was not decisive in favour of the
Maccab&aelig;an army, which retired and entrenched itself within the temple
fortress.</p>
<p>The outlying post of Bethsura was obliged to capitulate.</p>
<p>Philological grounds for the above identification are not wanting.&nbsp;
Bethsura and Bath Zacharias may have easily represented the Arabic or
Hebrew form of Bait Sahhoor.&nbsp; The guttural letter in the middle
naturally disappears in the Greek text, just as the Greek word
&ldquo;Assidean&rdquo; represents the Hebrew Chasidim in the same
history.</p>
<p>The following is a simple demonstration of the transition:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 434--><a name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
434</span>
<a href="images/p434.jpg">
<img alt="Transition from Hebrew via Greek to Arabic" src="images/p434.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>It may be asked, why did neither Josephus nor the author of the Books of
Maccabees tell us that Beth Zachariah was near Bethlehem?&nbsp; I answer:
first, the narrative did not make this necessary; secondly, Bethlehem was
then &ldquo;among the least of the thousands of Judah,&rdquo; her great day
had not yet arrived; and thus it might have been quite as necessary to say
that Bethlehem was near Beth Zachariah, as to say that Beth Zachariah was
near Bethlehem.</p>
<p>The modern name &ldquo;Bait Sahhoor of the Christians&rdquo; arises most
likely from the fact that a majority of the inhabitants,&mdash;thirty
families to twenty in the year 1851,&mdash;were of that religion, and from
its nearness to the field where it is believed the angels appeared to the
shepherds announcing the birth of Christ, with its subterranean chapel, the
crypt of a large church in former times.</p>
<p>The other Bait Sahhoor (El Wad&icirc;yeh) is so named from its position
on the side of the Wadi in Nar, or valley of the Kedron.&nbsp; It is only
occasionally inhabited, the people who claim it being too few to clear out
the encumbered cisterns for their use, but prefer to identify themselves
during most of the year with other villages, such as Siloam near at hand,
where water is more abundant.</p>
<h2><!-- page 435--><a name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
435</span>XVI.&nbsp; THE BAKOOSH COTTAGE.</h2>
<p>At about seven miles from Jerusalem lie the Pools of Solomon, commonly
called the &ldquo;Bur&acirc;k,&rdquo; upon the road to Hebron, which passes
by the head of the westernmost of them, on the left hand of the traveller
to that city; while immediately on the right hand, stands a hill with some
cultivation of vineyards and fig-trees, with a few olive-trees; apparently
half-way up that hill is a stone cottage, roughly but well built.&nbsp; It
is of that cottage and its grounds that I am about to speak, for there I
resided with my family for some weeks in 1860, and through the summer of
1862.</p>
<p>There is no village close at hand, the nearest one being <i>El
Khud&rsquo;r</i>, (or St George, so named from a small Greek convent in its
midst,) which, however, is only visible from the highway for a few minutes
at a particular bend of the road before reaching the Pools; the next
nearest, but in the opposite or eastern direction, is Urt&acirc;s, with its
profitable cultivation, nestled in a well-watered valley.</p>
<p><!-- page 436--><a name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
436</span>After these, in other directions again, are <i>Bait Jala</i>,
near Rachel&rsquo;s sepulchre, and Bethlehem, the sacred town whose name is
echoed wherever Christ is mentioned throughout the whole world, and will
continue to do so till the consummation of all things,&mdash;&ldquo;there
is no speech or language where its name is not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adjoining the Pools is the shell of a dilapidated khan, of old Saracenic
period, the outer enclosure alone being now entire.&nbsp; Two or three
Bashi-bozuk soldiers used to be stationed there, living in wretched hovels
inside the enclosure, made of fallen building stones, put together with
mud.&nbsp; On account of this being a government post, the peasantry of the
country, ignorant of all the world but themselves, denominate this old
square wall, &ldquo;The Castle,&rdquo; and that name is repeated by
dragomans to their European employers.</p>
<p>These were our nearest neighbours.</p>
<p>Close to the khan-gate and to the Pools is a perennial spring of
excellent water, which, of course, is of great value, and considering how
several roads meet at that point, and what a diversity of character there
is continually passing or halting there, it would seem to form the
perfection of an opening scene to some romantic tale.</p>
<p>Thus the Hebron highway lay between the Pools, with the khan on one
side, and the Bakoosh hill on the other, and no person or quadruped could
pass along it unobserved from our window.</p>
<p><!-- page 437--><a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
437</span>From the cottage, the more extended prospect comprised the stony,
treeless hills in every direction, the Pools forming the head of the valley
leading to Urt&acirc;s, and the outskirt beginning of green cultivation
there; then the streets and houses of Bethlehem; also the Frank mountain;
and at the back of all the Moab range of mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p437.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient Sepulchre on the Bakoosh" src="images/p437.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Within the wall enclosing the property of the cottage, with its fruit
trees already mentioned, there is one of the little round towers such as
are commonly seen about Bethlehem for summer residence of the cultivator
and his family during the season of fruit ripening, and which are meant by
the Biblical term of a tower built in the midst of a vineyard, (see Matthew
xxi. 33, and Isaiah v. 2.)&nbsp; It is remarkable how perfectly circular
these are <!-- page 438--><a name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
438</span>always built, though so small in size.&nbsp; We had also a
receptacle for beehives, and an ancient sepulchre.</p>
<p>The hill rises very steeply, but being as usual formed into ledges or
terraces, upon one of these, in a corner near the wall, the stable was
constructed of a small tent, near a big tree, within the shadow of which,
and of a bank, the horses were picketed.</p>
<p>Upon the other ledges were arranged the tents for sleeping in at night,
and alongside of the cottage a kitchen was made of a wall and a roof made
of branches of trees brought from a distance.</p>
<p>Such was our abode in the pure mountain breezes, with unclouded
sunshine, and plenty of good spring water within reach.</p>
<p>Inside the stone walls of the house we stayed during the heat of the
day; the children learned their lessons there, and I transacted business in
writing, when my presence in Jerusalem was not absolutely required by those
carrying on the current daily affairs; indeed the reason for resorting to
this place was the necessity for obtaining recruitment of health, after a
serious illness brought on by arduous labour.&nbsp; Had not unforeseen
anxieties come upon us, no lot on earth could have been more perfectly
delicious in the quality of enjoyment, both for body and spirit, than that
sojourn upon the wild hill; among ourselves were innocence and union,
consequently peace; time <!-- page 439--><a name="page439"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 439</span>was profitably spent; and our recreations
were, practice in the tonic sol-fa singing lessons, with sketching and
rambling on foot or on horseback over the breezy heights of Judah.</p>
<p>And whether by evening twilight, or at the rising of the sun out of the
Moab mountains, or earlier still, by summer morning starlight, when Sirius
and Canopus (the latter unseen in England) vied with each other in
sparkling their varied colours to praise their Maker in the firmament, His
handiwork; those rambles were sources of delight that cannot be expressed
in human language; they were, however, not novelties after so many
years&rsquo; residence in that Asiatic climate, but had become wrought into
our very existence.</p>
<p>Our Sabbaths were happy and conscientiously observed; we kept up the
services of the Church of England as far as practicable, and sometimes had
a visitor to join us in the same, not omitting the hymn singing.</p>
<p>The two domestic servants were of different Christian communities; for
the woman was a Latin, and would sometimes repair to her church-service at
Bethlehem, and the Abyssinian lad might be heard morning and evening, or at
night in the moonlight&mdash;such moonlight as we had there!&mdash;reading
the Gospels and Psalms in his soft native language, or even singing to a
kir&acirc;r (or lute) of his own making, hymns with a chorus of
&ldquo;Alleluia, Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 440--><a name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
440</span>Another of our gratifications should not be omitted, namely, the
hearing of the large church bell of the Latins in Bethlehem on certain
occasions, and always on Sunday mornings; at the moment of the sun peering
over the eastern horizon that great bell struck, and was followed by a gush
of the sweetest irregular music from smaller bells, probably belonging to
the Greeks, and then by the nakoos (plank) of the Armenians, a relic of
their primitive customs, serving for a bell, <a name="citation440"></a><a
href="#footnote440" class="citation">[440]</a>&mdash;all these acting with
one consent and with one intention, that of celebrating &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s day,&rdquo; as the early Christians delighted to call the
first day of the week.</p>
<p>From our window we had the city of David and of David&rsquo;s Lord
before us, and over the window on the inside I had inscribed in large
Arabic inscription-characters, &ldquo;O Son of David, have mercy upon
us!&rdquo; we had therefore the writing and the town at the same glance of
view.</p>
<p>We were not without visitors: sometimes a friend or two or three would
arrive from Jerusalem&mdash;travellers along the road would mount the hill
to see us&mdash;rabbis of Hebron on the way to Jerusalem, or Jews from the
distance of Tiberias <!-- page 441--><a name="page441"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 441</span>passing to Hebron, would turn aside to pay
their respects&mdash;Arab chiefs, such as Ismaeen Hhamd&acirc;n of the
Ta&rsquo;amra&mdash;Turkish officers, or even the Pasha himself, found the
way to the cottage&mdash;also officers of the British navy, when visiting
the sacred localities from Jaffa.&nbsp; Among these I would not forget the
chaplain of one of our men-of-war, who brought up ten of his best men,
namely, the Bible and temperance class under his charge, to see the
venerated places, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the Mount of Olives.&nbsp; On
one occasion we had a surveying party with their instruments from H.M.S.
<i>Firefly</i>, who passed some nights with us.</p>
<p>On the higher boundary the land was still in its natural condition of
stones, fossil shells, and green shrubs with fragrant herbs.&nbsp; There
might be seen occasionally starting up before the intruding wanderer,
partridges, hares, quails, the wild pigeon, the fox, or even</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The wild gazelle on Judah&rsquo;s hills<br />
&nbsp;  Exultingly would bound,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and escape also, for I carried no gun with me.</p>
<p>Mounting still higher we came upon the <i>Dahar-es-Sal&acirc;hh</i>, a
mountain whence the prospect of all Philistia and the coast from almost
Gaza to Carmel expands like a map&mdash;no, rather like a thing of still
life before the eye, with the two seas, namely, the Mediterranean and the
Dead Sea, visible at once, with likewise the mountains of <!-- page
442--><a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 442</span>Samaria and
Gerizim, besides the Moab country eastward, and Jerusalem and Bethlehem
nearer home.</p>
<p>Close at hand upon the mountain on which we thus stand, are vestiges of
a monastic house and chapel called &ldquo;Khirbet el Kasees,&rdquo; (the
priest&rsquo;s ruins,) and even more interesting objects still, the remains
of older edifices, distinguished by ponderous rabbeted stones.</p>
<p>On the mountain top is a large oval space, which has been walled round,
fragments of the enclosure are easily traceable, as also some broken
columns, gray and weather-beaten.&nbsp; This has every appearance of having
been one of the many sun-temples devoted to Baal by early Syrians.</p>
<p>By temple I here mean a succession of open-air courts, with a central
altar for sacrifice; a mound actually exists on the highest spot of
elevation, which may well have been the site of the altar.</p>
<p>What a vast prospect does this spot command, not only of landscape in
every direction, but of sky from which the false worshipper might survey
the sun&rsquo;s entire daily course, from its rising out of the vague
remote lands of &ldquo;the children of the East,&rdquo; and riding in
meridian splendour over the land of Israel&rsquo;s God, till, slowly
descending and cloudless to the very last, it dips behind the blue waters
of &ldquo;the great sea!&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas! to think that such a spot as
this should ever have been desecrated by worship of the creature within
actual <!-- page 443--><a name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
443</span>sight of that holy mountain where the divine glory appeared, more
dazzling than the brightest effulgence of the created sun.</p>
<p>Sloping westwards from the <i>Dahar-es-Sal&acirc;hh</i> were agreeable
rides over a wilderness of green shrubs with occasional pine and karoobah
trees, and rough rocks on the way to <i>Nahh&acirc;leen</i> or <i>Bait
Ezk&acirc;reh</i>, from which we catch a view of the valley of Shocoh, the
scene of David&rsquo;s triumph over Goliath, and beyond that the hill of
Santa Anna at <i>Bait Jibreen</i>.&nbsp; The region there is lonely and
silent, with some petty half-depopulated villages in sight, but all far
away; sometimes a couple or so of peasants may be met upon the road driving
an ass loaded with charcoal or broken old roots of the evergreen oak.&nbsp;
Evening excursions in that direction were not infrequent for the purpose of
seeing the sun set into the sea, from which the breeze came up so
refreshingly.</p>
<p>The home resources gave us among the fruit trees, goldfinches,
bee-eaters in blue or green and gold, and beccaficas, the latter for food,
but so tame that they would stay upon the branches while the gun was
levelled at them; in fact, little Alexander, returning one day with several
of them that he had shot, complained of want of sport, quoting the lines of
his namesake Selkirk in Cowper,&mdash;&ldquo;Their tameness is shocking to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally we got water-hens or coots that had been shot upon the
Pools of Solomon; only <!-- page 444--><a name="page444"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 444</span>sometimes it was not possible to fish them out
as they fell into the water, and so became entangled among the gigantic
weeds that grow up from the bottom to the level of the surface, and among
which the men were afraid to venture their swimming.&nbsp; Pelicans we did
not see, although one had been previously brought from thence to Jerusalem,
and was stuffed for the Museum.&nbsp; Then we had water-cresses from the
aqueduct, at a place where its side was partly broken between the upper and
the second pool.&nbsp; Often for a treat we had water particularly light
for drinking brought from the spring of Etam, (2 Chron. xi. 6.)&nbsp; Figs
and grapes were furnished from the ground itself, and at the end of August
the Shaikh Jad Allah sent us a present of fresh honeycomb, according to the
custom on opening a hive at the end of summer, (in that country the bees
are never destroyed for the sake of the honey;) presents thereof are sent
round to neighbours, and of course presents of some other produce are given
in return.&nbsp; Palestine is still a land abounding in honey.</p>
<p>Occasional incidents occurred on the plain at the foot of the
hill,&mdash;such as a long line of camels kneeling and growling upon the
high road, while their drivers were swimming during the blaze of noontide
in the parts of the large pool free from weeds; or military expeditions
passing on to Hebron during the night, and called up by bugle after resting
a couple of hours at the castle-gate; <!-- page 445--><a
name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>or camel-loads of
pine-branches swinging in stately procession from the southern hills beyond
Hebron towards Jerusalem, to furnish tabernacles for the Jewish festival;
or an immense party of Kerak people from beyond the Dead Sea, with their
camels, asses, mules, besides flocks, for sale, conveying butter and wheat
to Jerusalem, encamped below us and singing at their watch-fires by
night.</p>
<p>Large fires were sometimes visible upon the Moab mountains at the
distance of thirty or forty miles in a straight line.&nbsp; These may have
arisen from carelessness, or accidental circumstances, among either
standing corn or the heaps of harvest in the open air; or they may even
have been wilful conflagrations made by hostile tribes in their raids upon
each other.&nbsp; In any case they showed that wherever such things
occurred in ancient times, Ruth the Moabitess, when settled in Bethlehem,
might still have been reminded in that way of her native country, which lay
before her view.</p>
<p>At the Bakoosh we heard the single gun-fire at sunrise or sunset while
the Pasha had his camp at Hebron; and from the highest part of our hill
could see the flash of the guns in the castle of Jerusalem when saluting
the birthday of Mohammed.</p>
<p>For domestic incidents we had the children pelting each other with
acorns by moonlight; bonfires made by them and the servants on the terrace
to show us the way when returning at a late hour from Jerusalem; large
bunches of grapes from <!-- page 446--><a name="page446"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 446</span>the adjoining vineyard, the <i>Karaweesh</i>,
suspended against the wall, reserved to become raisins.&nbsp; Then family
presents upon a birthday, all derived from the ground itself,&mdash;one
person bringing a bunch of wild thyme in purple blossom,&mdash;another some
sprigs from a terebinth tree, with the reviving odour of its gum that was
exuding from the bark,&mdash;and another a newly-caught chameleon.</p>
<p>The latter was for several days afterwards indulged with a fresh bough
of a tree for his residence, changed about, one day of oak, next of
terebinth, then of sumach, or of pine, etc.</p>
<p>Such was our &ldquo;sweet home&rdquo; and family life on the Byeways of
Palestine.</p>
<p>But a time came when care and anxiety told heavily upon mine and my
wife&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; For some days I was confined to bed in the tent,
unable to move up to the house; yet enjoying the reading of my chapters in
Hebrew in the land of Israel, or ruminating over the huge emphasis of St
Paul&rsquo;s Greek in 2 Cor. iv. 17, &kappa;&alpha;&theta;
&upsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&eta;&nu;
&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;
&upsilon;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&eta;&nu;.
&kappa;.&tau;.&lambda;.&nbsp; The curtains of the tent were thrown wide
open at each side for the admission of air; the children were playing or
reading on the shady side of another tent; muleteer and camel parties I
could observe mounting or falling with the rises and dips of the Hebron
road; and the jingle of bells or the singing of the men was audible or
alternately lost according to the same circumstances.&nbsp; I lay watching
the progress of <!-- page 447--><a name="page447"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 447</span>sunshine or shadow around the Frank mountain
as the hours rolled on; then as evening approached the Egyptian groom took
down the Egyptian mare to water at the spring, followed by the foal of pure
Sakl&acirc;wi race, that never till the preceding day had had even so much
as a halter put across his head,&mdash;a Bashi-bozuk soldier with his pipe
looking on,&mdash;the Abyssinian lad carrying pitchers of water to the
several tents, and the pools of bright blue becoming darker blue when
rippled by the evening air.&nbsp; All this was food for enjoyment of the
picturesque, but at the same time God Almighty was leading us into deep
trials of faith in Himself, and bringing out the value of that
promise,&mdash;&ldquo;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with
thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the autumn advanced, some slight sprinkling of rain fell&mdash;dews
at night were heavy&mdash;mists rose from below&mdash;mornings and evenings
became cooled&mdash;new flowers began to appear, such as the purple crocus,
and certain yellow blossoms belonging to the season, the name of which I do
not know.&nbsp; We therefore began to take farewell rides about the
neighbourhood, as to places we were never to see again.&nbsp; One of these
was to a very archaic pile of rude masonry, deeply weather-eaten, at a
ruined site called <i>Bait Saweer</i>, through green woods and
arbutus-trees, glowing with scarlet berries; a place which had only
recently been <!-- page 448--><a name="page448"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 448</span>brought to my notice, and of which no European
had any knowledge.</p>
<p>The old building, whose use we could not discover, was composed, not of
ordinary blocks of stone, but of huge flat slabs, unchiselled at edges or
corners, laid one over another, but forming decidedly an intentional
edifice.&nbsp; It is well worth further examination.&nbsp; At the time we
had with us no materials for sketching, and never had an opportunity of
going thither afterwards.</p>
<p>It lies among the wild green scene west from the Hebron road, near
where, on the opposite, or east side, is the opening of the Wadi
&rsquo;Aroob, with its copious springs.</p>
<p>Then we went to <i>Marseea&rsquo;</i>, beyond the <i>Dair el
Ben&acirc;t</i>&mdash;equally unknown to Europeans&mdash;and, lastly, to
the green slopes and precipices towards <i>Nahh&acirc;leen</i>, where,
lingering till after sunset, we became in a few minutes enveloped in a
cloud of mist tossed and rolled along by gusts of wind, and several large
eagles rose screaming from perches among rocks below us into the misty air,
as if rejoicing in the boisterous weather.</p>
<p>Three months before, we had been on the same spot at the moment of
sunset, and saw the whole Philistine plain hidden in a white mist in a
single minute, but, of course, far below us; and this, we were told, was
the usual state of things, and would remain so for another month, after
which the plain would have no mist, but we should have it all on <!-- page
449--><a name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 449</span>the
mountains at sunset&mdash;so it was now found to be the case.</p>
<p>From one spot on our own grounds we were able to point out as objects in
the magnificent prospect&mdash;the Moab mountains, the crevasse of the
Jabbok into the Gh&ocirc;r, that of Calirrhoe into the Dead Sea, Hhalhhool
near Hebron, El Khud&rsquo;r below us, Rachel&rsquo;s sepulchre, Bethlehem,
Nebi Samwil, the Scopus, Jerusalem, and our house there, to which we were
soon to remove.</p>
<p>Before, however, quitting this subject of the Bakoosh, I may refer to
one very special attraction that held us to the place, namely, an
agricultural undertaking in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; A friend, of whom I
hope to speak more in another time and place, superintended for me the
rebuilding of an ancient Biblical village that lay a heap and a desolation,
and cleared out its spring of water, which, by being choked up with
rubbish, made its way unseen under ground, it thus became nearly as copious
as that alongside of Solomon&rsquo;s Pools.&nbsp; I gathered people into
the village, vineyards were planted, crops were sown and reaped there,
taxes were paid to the government; and the vicinity, which previously had
been notorious for robberies on the Hebron road, became perfectly
secure.</p>
<p>On one of my visits, a list was presented to me of ninety-eight
inhabitants, where a year and a half before there was not one.&nbsp;
Homesteads <!-- page 450--><a name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
450</span>were rebuilt; the people possessed horned cattle and flocks of
sheep and goats, as well as beehives.&nbsp; I saw women grinding at the
mill, and at one of the doors a cat and a kitten.&nbsp; All was going on
prosperously.</p>
<p>Purer pleasure have I never experienced than when, in riding over
occasionally with our children, we saw the threshing of wheat and barley in
progress, and heard the women singing, or the little children shouting at
their games.&nbsp; Sixty cows used to be driven at noon to drink at the
spring.</p>
<p>We returned to Jerusalem on the 21st of October, and on the 28th of
November that village was again a mass of ruin&mdash;the houses
demolished&mdash;the people dispersed&mdash;their newly-sown corn and the
vineyards ploughed over&mdash;the fine spring of water choked up once
more&mdash;and my Australian trees planted there torn up by the
roots.&nbsp; All this was allowed to be done within nine miles of
Jerusalem, to gratify persons engaged in an intrigue which ended in deeds
far worse than this.</p>
<p>Our village was <i>Faghoor</i>, and had been one of the ancient towns of
the tribe of Judah.&nbsp; Its place in the Bible is Joshua xv., where it is
found in the Greek Septuagint together with Tekoah, Etham, and Bethlehem,
all noted places&mdash;neither of which is contained in the Hebrew text,
and therefore not in the English translation.</p>
<p>It seems difficult to account for this; but it may possibly be that
neither of these towns were <!-- page 451--><a name="page451"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 451</span>ever in the Hebrew of that chapter, that they
were not well known at the time of the original Hebrew being written; but
that when the translation of the Septuagint was made, the writers knew by
other means, though living in Egypt, that Tekoah, Etham, Bethlehem, and
Faghoor had been for a long period famous within the tribe of Judah, and
therefore they filled up what seemed to them a deficiency in the
register.</p>

<h3>A.&mdash;Page 32.</h3>
<p>The signs here referred to were guessed by Buckingham (about 1816) to be
possibly some distinctive tokens of Arab tribes; but he seemed rather
inclined to connect them with marks that are found in Indian caverns, or
those on the rocks about Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>He was thus nearer to the truth than the latest of travellers, De
Saulcy, who, with all his knowledge of Semitic alphabets, says of some of
these <i>graffiti</i>, or scratchings, at &rsquo;Amm&acirc;n, which he
copied: &ldquo;Tout cela, je regrette fort, est lettre close pour
moi.&nbsp; Quelle est cette &eacute;criture?&nbsp; Je
l&rsquo;ignore.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Voyage en Terre Sainte.&nbsp; Tom. i. p.256.
Paris, 1865.)</p>
<p>They are characters adopted by Arabs to distinguish one tribe from
another, and commonly used for branding the camels on the shoulders and
haunches, by which means the animals may be recovered, if straying and
found by Arabs not hostile to the owners.</p>
<p>I have, however, seen them scratched upon walls in many places
frequented by Bedaween, as, for instance, in <!-- page 453--><a
name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>the ruined convents,
churches, etc., on the plain of the Jordan, and occasionally, as at
&rsquo;Amm&acirc;n, several such cyphers are united into one complex
character.</p>

<p>Considerable discrepancy may be found among the transcripts furnished by
travellers in their published works, of the Greek votive inscriptions about
the entrance of the cavern of Pan at Banias.</p>
<p>I give the following as the result of careful study of <!-- page
454--><a name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 454</span>them in
1849, and again, after the lapse of six years, in 1855, each time examining
the writing, under varieties of light and shade, at different hours of the
day.</p>
<p>There are some other inscriptions, which are entirely blackened with
smoke, in the niches, made perhaps by ancient burning of lamps or of
incense there.&nbsp; This is particularly the case in one large hollow made
in the rock, which has almost its whole surface covered with Greek
writing.&nbsp; Within this hollow a niche is cut out, now empty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p455.jpg">

<p><!-- page 455--><a name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

than Vespasian and Titus, who had had one and the same Triumph in Rome on

<p>It is peculiarly suitable to that place, inasmuch as Titus, previous to
leaving the country, had celebrated there the birthday of his brother
Domitian, with magnificent public spectacles&mdash;amid which, however,
more than 2500 Jews were destroyed for popular amusement, by burning,
fighting, and in combats with wild beasts.</p>
<p>Although these are copied with much painstaking, there may be errors
unperceived in some of the letters; but at least one of the words is
misspelt by the provincial artist, namely,

sums are exacted by the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n for their escort upon this same
journey as ours.&nbsp; It may, therefore, be acceptable to learn what was
our contract, and that it was honourably acted upon&mdash;namely, three of
the party to pay 1000 piastres each, and 200 each for all the rest.&nbsp;
As there were twelve in the party, the amount was</p>
<p style="text-align: right">1000 x 3 = 3000<br />
200 x 9 = 1800<br />
----<br />
4800</p>
<p>This total we among ourselves divided equally, equal to 400 each.</p>
<p>We also agreed to make a present from each when in the territory,
besides giving a feast at &rsquo;Amm&acirc;n, and another at
Jerash&mdash;the feasts were a mere trifle.</p>
<p>A hundred piastres came to rather less than a pound sterling.</p>
<p>I am glad to confirm the recent testimonies of Tristram and De Saulcy as
to the honourable and noble deportment of Gubl&acirc;n and the other
leaders of the &rsquo;Adw&acirc;n people.</p>

<p><a name="footnote155"></a><a href="#citation155"

country people that between Gaza and Beersheba it is the practice to sow
wheat very thinly indeed, and to expect every seed to produce thirty to
fifty stalks, and every stalk to give forty seeds.</p>
<p><a name="footnote182"></a><a href="#citation182"
class="footnote">[182]</a>&nbsp; In a journey to Gaza from Hebron, in the
spring season of 1853, I was proceeding from the great oak down a long
valley&mdash;but I was induced to deviate from the direct line by the
tidings of <i>Bait Jibreen</i> being infested or taken by the Tiy&acirc;hah
Arabs.</p>
<p>We everywhere found the peasantry armed, and on arriving before <i>Dair
Nahh&acirc;z</i>, almost within sight of that town, and communicating with
the village for water to drink, as I rested under a tree, Mohammed
&rsquo;Abd en Nebi sent me word that Bait Jibreen was recovered from the
Arabs, and now occupied by themselves; that thirty-five corpses of Arabs
were lying round Bait Jibreen, and one of the two Arab chiefs (Amer) was
slain&mdash;he himself was wounded in the knee.</p>
<p>From hence to Gaza we passed <i>Zeita</i>, where a breastwork had been
hastily thrown up by the peasantry, and into which a number of armed men
rushed from a concealment, and parleyed before they would allow us to pass
on.&nbsp; Then to <i>Falooja</i>, and between <i>Idsaid</i> and
<i>Karatiyah</i> on our right, and the Ar&acirc;k Munsh&icirc;yah on the
left.&nbsp; Halted at Brair for the night.</p>
<p>The return from Gaza was by Ascal&acirc;n, Mejdal, Julis, the two
Sawafeers, Kasteeneh, Mesm&icirc;yeh, and Latron, on the Jaffa road to
Jerusalem.</p>

Syriac <i>d</i>&rsquo; signifying <i>of</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote207"></a><a href="#citation207"
class="footnote">[207]</a>&nbsp; It is worthy of notice that Suw&acirc;n
(in Arabic) (diminutive, <i>Suwaineet</i>) signifies
&ldquo;flint.&rdquo;&nbsp; These rocks being flinty, it is possible that
<i>Seneh</i> in Hebrew may have had the same meaning.</p>
<p><a name="footnote217"></a><a href="#citation217"
class="footnote">[217]</a>&nbsp; &rsquo;Ar&acirc;beh does not appear in any

<p><a name="footnote238"></a><a href="#citation238"
class="footnote">[238]</a>&nbsp; It is worthy of note, that in this single
place the ancient name of Carmel is preserved among the people.&nbsp; This
being called <i>D&acirc;liet el Carmel</i> to distinguish it from the
D&acirc;lieh of the Rohha district, yet the denomination Carmel is not
otherwise given to this mountain by the Arab population.&nbsp; D&acirc;lieh
signifies &ldquo;a vine,&rdquo; this, therefore, is the &ldquo;vine of
Carmel,&rdquo; and Carmel itself signifies &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
vineyard!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote301"></a><a href="#citation301"
class="footnote">[301]</a>&nbsp; Yet there was a &ldquo;city of
palm-trees&rdquo; towards the south, which the Kenites abandoned for this
district south of Arad,&mdash;probably the present <i>Nukh&rsquo;l</i>; the
name has that signification.</p>
<p><a name="footnote302"></a><a href="#citation302"
class="footnote">[302]</a>&nbsp; There are many such <i>cachets</i> of
water in the desert, but known only to the tribes of each district.&nbsp;
During the Israelitish wanderings, Hobab, a native of the desert, may have
guided them to many such.</p>
<p><a name="footnote304"></a><a href="#citation304"
class="footnote">[304]</a>&nbsp; It is not to be supposed, however, that
this is a just representation of all that &ldquo;great and terrible
wilderness&rdquo; through which the Israelites were led for forty
years.&nbsp; It is indeed &ldquo;a land not sown,&rdquo; (Jer. ii. 2,) and
a land of pits and drought fearful to contemplate, as a journey for a
wandering population of nearly two millions of souls, especially in the
hottest seasons of the year; but the peculiarly terrible wilderness must
have been among the defiles, hemmed in by scorching cliffs in the Sinaitic
peninsula.</p>
<p>In that direction also were the &ldquo;fiery flying serpents,&rdquo;
concerning which I have never been able to learn anything more satisfactory
than that, in the hot and unpeopled gorges west of the Dead Sea, there is a
thin and yellow serpent called the Neshabiyeh, which flings itself across
from one point to another in the air with astonishing velocity and
force.&nbsp; It is therefore named after Nesh&acirc;beh, a dart or arrow in
Arabic.&nbsp; The natives also apply to it the epithet of
&ldquo;flying.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wound which it inflicts is said to be
highly inflammatory and deadly, and from this effect it may be called
&ldquo;fiery.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be also that, from being of a yellow
colour, it may glitter like a flame when flying with rapidity in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>It is only in Isaiah xxx. 6, that the epithet &ldquo;flying&rdquo; is
used for these serpents.&nbsp; Observe, however, in Hebrew Lexicons the
several applications of this word &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;.</p>

everything of antiquity here to Pharaoh, the cursed king of Egypt,&mdash;as
those about the Euphrates attribute all their old wonders to the cursed
king Nimrod.&nbsp; These names are learned from the Kor&acirc;n.</p>
<p><a name="footnote320"></a><a href="#citation320"

gone from Jerusalem in virtue of the agreement made on this occasion by me,

different times on most parts, north, west, and south of the lake, and read

<p><a name="footnote339"></a><a href="#citation339"
class="footnote">[339]</a>&nbsp; Since writing the above, we learn from
Lieutenant Warren&rsquo;s very interesting letters that the Turkish
Government have sent a large force into the trans-Jordanic region, with a

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
